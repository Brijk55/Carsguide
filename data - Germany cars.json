A redesign this year improves power and refinement, making it one of the best all-around hatchbacks on the road. The Volkswagen Golf GTI is a 5-seater vehicle that comes in 3 trim levels. The most popular style is the 2.0T SE DSG, which starts at $36,525 and comes with a 2.0L I4 Turbo engine and Front Wheel Drive.

It delivers strong acceleration and handling that's as engaging on the morning commute as on winding back roads. It has an attractive interior with quality details throughout. The top Autobahn trim delivers a true premium experience. Despite this little hatch's compact dimensions, it has a good amount of cargo room, making it a versatile choice. Although there's seating for five, the rear seats aren't particularly spacious; adult passengers won't be happy there for long.\n\nCompetitors include the Subaru WRX, a sporty hatchback with standard all-wheel drive so it's plenty capable when winter weather arrives. The Hyundai Veloster delivers more power than the GTI at a lower price across its lineup. The Honda Civic is available as a sedan or a hatchback that includes the performance-focused Type R, which boasts impressive horsepower.\n",

The interior has a completely new look highlighted by the Audi Digital Cockpit, which puts maps and other information right in the driver's face. The infotainment screen is larger, too. Front seats are exceptionally comfortable yet supportive for spirited driving, and three adults fit comfortably in the rear. In all, the A3 has a near-perfect interior.\n\nThe Audi A3 is a couple of inches longer than its most direct competitor, the Mercedes-Benz A-Class.

But two strong motivations for sedan ownership are affordability and improved handling. For five decades, the Volkswagen Passat has been a strong seller due to German engineering and design aesthetics. However, popular Japanese manufacturers Honda and Toyota have always dominated the segment. Now the time has come for Volkswagen to retire its largest passenger car; 2022 will be the last model year for the Passat.\n\nBuyers can choose from either a Passat SE base model, the sporty Passat R-Line, or the newly packaged 2022 Passat Limited Edition â€” of which only 1,973 units are being made. That number is based on the year production at the Chattanooga, Tennessee, VW plant began.\n",

Don't let the looks deceive you, however, as the Arteon is a surprisingly spacious car that comfortably accommodates four adults. It has a hatchback design instead of trunk, so there's plenty of easily accessible cargo space. Like most Volkswagen sedans, the Arteon has a refined, sporty feel thanks to a firm suspension and precise steering. It's no sport sedan, but it's not a cushy cruiser either. The 2022 Arteon gets a new 300-horsepower engine and seven-speed automatic transmission. Front-wheel drive is standard, and all-wheel drive is optional. The interior is well built and attractive, but the materials are not quite up to luxury-brand standards. The touchscreen interface is small compared to rivals' larger, easy-to-read displays. There aren't many direct competitors in this category anymore, but the Acura TLX is worth a look, as well as the Genesis G70.",

Riding on a slightly raised suspension with additional height available from the adaptive air suspension, the A6 Allroad can tackle moderate dirt and trail routes when not doing double duty as a family shuttle. While certainly a prime pick for outdoorsy lifestyles, the Allroad is probably better thought of as a sure-footed all-weather wagon, ideal for driving confidently in snowy and wet climates.\n\nFor buyers who blanch at the idea of piloting an SUV, crossover, or even, oof, a minivan, the A6 Allroad makes a compelling choice. It offers all the goodness of Audi's A6 midsize luxury sedan, then adds length and a whole lot of cargo space. The ride is quiet, smooth, and absorbent. The Allroad is not as playful behind the wheel as its smaller A4 Allroad sibling, and that's a bit of a disappointment. But none of its rivals are particularly engaging either. You'll forget all that though when you slide into the optional massaging front seats, cue up route guidance from the sharp nav system, and set the cabin lights to a purple hue.\n\nOnly a few other buff luxury wagons are available in the U.S., including the Volvo V90 Cross Country and Mercedes-Benz E450 All-Terrain.

Both bodystyles are BMW's entry-level models with starting prices in the mid-$30K range. The 2 Series is far from entry-entry level when it comes to performance. The Gran Coupe is the less-powerful sibling, yet even its base 228i model is quick to accelerate and nimble around town. The newly redesigned 2 Series coupe is more powerful and agile than before, so it delivers the feel of a sports car in a handsome package with rear seats that can be used in a pinch. The Gran Coupe has four doors and slightly more room in back, but it too, is tight for rear passengers. All 2 Series models feature premium interiors and solid build quality. The technology interface is an easy-to-use dash-mounted touchscreen. A digital instrument panel is optional along with a head-up display. Most of the design and materials are pulled from the more-expensive BMW 3 Series lineup, so the 2 Series doesn't display any obvious signs of cost cutting.

This i4 is estimated to deliver 109 MPGe in the city and 108 MPGe on the highway.\n\n\nPros\n\nImpressive range and performance\nLooks like a normal sport sedan\nOutstanding infotainment interface and display\n\nCons\n\nLacks features that should come standard for the price (heated seats)\nPrice escalates quickly with a few options and packages\n\nOverall Assessment\n\nExciting, innovative, and a window to the future, today's electric vehicle revolution is a wonderful moment in time. But, real talk now: It's turning out some ugly cars. Sure, style is subjective, but one of the most appealing traits of the 2022 BMW i4 is its shocking normalcy compared to its hyper-styled peers.\n\nBut for the badges and a few aerodynamic bits, the i4 looks like the sleek four-door BMW 4 Series Gran Coupe. It even shares the same basic dimensions. Finely tuned suspension and steering settings, plus a low center of gravity, give the i4 the sporty and agile handling for which BMW is known. But with 335 horsepower in the base trim and up to 536 hp in the high-performance M50, the i4 vaults over its gas-powered counterparts in speed, performance, and instant, low-end power.\n\nWith 227 to 300 miles of driving range (depending on trim), the i4 has a wide range of competitors, from the Audi e-tron and Polestar 2 to the Ford Mustang Mach-E and Kia EV6. And it outdistances its primary rival, the Tesla Model 3 Standard Range Plus. The i4 offers less cargo space than most EVs, but it packs more punch and performance, and its infotainment interface sets a new standard. With its understated style and over-caffeinated performance, the i4 provides a refreshing take on the electric future.\n",

      "name": "2022 Audi A4 allroad",
      "description": "Overview\n\nCombining luxury, style, and sportiness in a rugged, off-road package, the Audi A4 Allroad is a compelling alternative for buyers who want utility without the bulk or height of an SUV. The Audi A4 allroad is a 5-seater vehicle that comes in 3 trim levels. The most popular style is the Premium Plus, which starts at $50,795 and comes with a 2.0L I4 Turbo engine and All Wheel Drive. This A4 allroad is estimated to deliver 24 MPG in the city and 30 MPG on the highway.\n\n\nPros\n\nAttractive style, inside and out\nEngaging handling on dry roads, confidence-inspiring when wet\nSophisticated infotainment and technology features\n\nCons\n\nMany of today's more common driver aids don't come standard\nDecent cargo and passenger space, but some competitors offer more\n\nOverall Assessment\n\nIt's telling that in order for Audi to interest Americans in its wagon models, the automaker offers just a few choices, two of which it disguises as SUVs. One is the Audi A6 Allroad, the other the smaller Audi A4 Allroad. The Allroad rides on a slightly raised suspension, with more ground clearance than a regular sedan, protected by impact-resistant body cladding that gives it the visual heft of an off-roader with the style of a European sport wagon.\n\nSuch are the illusions necessary to attract attention in a country bewitched by crossovers, trucks, and SUVs. But for buyers who blanch at the idea of forcing their lifestyles and families into an SUV or minivan, the A4 Allroad makes a compelling alternative. With its low stance, the A4 Allroad drives like a longer version of its Audi A4 sedan sibling, with confident, stable handling and a smooth ride.\n\nOnly a few other rugged wagons still roam U.S. highways, including the Volvo V60 Cross Country and the Subaru Outback (/subaru/outback/). The Volvo takes cabin luxury to another level, while the Subaru offers more cargo and passenger space. Still, the Audi straddles the worlds of dirt and asphalt like few others.\n",

      "name": "2022 Mercedes-Benz CLA",
      "description": "Overview\n\nThe Mercedes CLA measures up to the luxury brand's reputation with sharp design, strong performance, and a comfortable, upscale interior that's packed with tech features. The Mercedes-Benz CLA is a 5-seater vehicle that comes in 3 trim levels. The most popular style is the CLA 250 4MATIC, which starts at $41,250 and comes with a 2.0L I4 Turbo engine and All Wheel Drive. This CLA is estimated to deliver 24 MPG in the city and 33 MPG on the highway.\n\n\nPros\n\nCool coupe-like exterior\nFour-door practicality\nTwo available high-performance AMG versions\n\nCons\n\nComplicated infotainment system\nTight rear seat\nNot as fuel-efficient as some rivals\nOverall Assessment\nThe Mercedes-Benz CLA may be one of the luxury brand's smallest and most affordable sedans, but it is every inch a Mercedes, with distinctive design, an impeccable interior, robust build quality, and world-class engineering. This is one of the best-looking small sedans on the planet, with a cool coupe-like silhouette and a sporty low and wide stance. Mercedes even calls the CLA a coupe, so don't confuse it with the Mercedes-Benz A-Class sedan, which is smaller, less powerful, and costs about $4,000 less. With a strong 221-horsepower turbocharged engine and well-tuned suspension, the CLA 250 delivers abundant driving pleasure, and the high-performance Mercedes-AMG variants, the CLA 35 and CLA 45, take a decidedly sporting turn. Some may find the CLA's infotainment system to be unnecessarily complex and its rear seat too snug, but overall, it competes very favorably with the two available variants of the BMW 2 Series Gran Coupe as well as the Audi A3, Audi S3, and Audi RS 3.",

      "name": "2022 Mercedes-Benz CLS",
      "description": "Overview\n\nThe Mercedes-Benz CLS merges coupe styling with the practicality of a four-door car, although rear-seat passengers might question how well it blends the two. An ultra-smooth engine and elegant cabin give it a true luxury feel. The Mercedes-Benz CLS is a 5-seater vehicle that comes in 1 trim levels. The most popular style is the CLS 450 Coupe 4MATIC, which starts at $74,000 and comes with a 3.0L I6 S/C and Turbo engine and All Wheel Drive. This CLS is estimated to deliver 22 MPG in the city and 30 MPG on the highway.\n\n\nPros\n\nPowerful and smooth standard engine\nOpulent cabin\nEasy-to-use infotainment system\n\nCons\n\nSleek styling results in a tight backseat\nSmall trunk for a sedan of its size\nOverall Assessment\nThe Mercedes-Benz CLS is a luxury sedan with a turbocharged engine and opulent interior. It accelerates quickly and handles smoothly, keeping its composure around corners. Inside, the CLS provides seating for five people. Passengers in the rear may feel cramped due to the car's sloping roofline, but those upfront get plenty of head- and legroom. The CLS comes with many technology and safety features, and it offers plenty of optional equipment as well. Starting at $74,000, the Mercedes-Benz CLS is actually one of the more affordable options in its class. Its closest competitor, the BMW 8 Series, is priced at $86,000. Another alternative to the CLS is the Audi A7 priced from $70,000.",

      "description": "Overview\n\nThe all-new 516-horsepower Mercedes EQS electric sedan impresses with a limousine-like cabin in a modern, aerodynamic five-seat package that provides up to 350 miles of electric driving range. The Mercedes-Benz EQS is a 5-seater vehicle that comes in 3 trim levels. The most popular style is the EQS 450+ RWD, which starts at $103,360 and comes with an Electric engine and Rear Wheel Drive.

By leading the electric charge with an S-Class-worthy luxury five-seater, the long-running German automaker is showing just how serious it is about electrifying its products in the coming years.\n\nThe 2022 EQS has a presence that won't be ignored, from the aerodynamic shape and long wheelbase to the radically different cab-forward profile, hidden hatchback, and extra-large rear seat. The 329-horsepower EQS 450+ is a first-rate premium electric sedan, but the EQS 580 with 516 zippy horsepower, added 4matic all-wheel drive, and best of all, the 56-inch-wide Hyperscreen dash display is the one that you just have to experience. The battery-electric EQS sedan brings true luxury and craftsmanship as well as leading-edge technology to the premium EV space.\n",
