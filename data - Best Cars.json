      "description": "Overview\n\nIt may not be quite as engaging to drive as the class-leading Honda Accord, but the Hyundai Sonata offers strong value in its segment with distinctive styling and upscale features. With an available gas-electric hybrid and the 290-horsepower N Line performance version, there's a Sonata for almost every buyer. The Hyundai Sonata is a 5-seater vehicle that comes in 9 trim levels. The most popular style is the SEL, which starts at $27,345 and comes with a 2.5L I4 engine and Front Wheel Drive. This Sonata is estimated to deliver 27 MPG in the city and 37 MPG on the highway.\n\nPros\n\nExcellent variety of offerings\nIntuitive tech features\nClass-leading warranty\n\nCons\n\nHigh-performance engine is limited to the pricey N Line trim\nRear seat isn't as spacious as some competitors\nOverall Assessment\nThe Hyundai Sonata, now in its second year after a complete redesign, continues to provide a compelling value proposition among midsize sedans. With attractive lines, excellent safety features, a well-appointed cabin, and a wide variety of powertrains — from conventional gasoline engines to a gas-electric hybrid — the Sonata offers performance and features on par with longtime standard-bearers in the class, such as the Toyota Camry and the Honda Accord, while undercutting them on price.",

There are also plenty of models available, from efficient hybrids to a high-performance variant. The Hyundai Elantra is a 5-seater vehicle that comes in 6 trim levels. The most popular style is the Hybrid Limited DCT, which starts at $30,095 and comes with a Hybrid 1.6L I4 engine and Front Wheel Drive. This Elantra is estimated to deliver 49 MPG in the city and 52 MPG on the highway.\n\nPros\n\nSpacious interior for the class\nComprehensive list of safety features\nIndustry-leading warranty\n\nCons\n\nAbundance of hard interior plastics\nBase engine is merely adequate\nOverall Assessment\n\nThe 2023 Hyundai Elantra stands out from other compact sedans with its sharply creased and faceted sheet metal as well as its broad grille with integrated wraparound headlights. But don't think that it's only about style, because it also has plenty of substance to prove its worth. In the Hyundai lineup, the Elantra fills the gap between the smaller Accent and midsize Sonata. Much like the larger Sonata, the Elantra is offered in several variants that include an affordable base trim, very efficient hybrids, and a sporty alternative. It goes one step further with a higher performance Elantra N model with 276 horsepower.\n\nCompared to other sedans in this class, such as the Honda Civic and Toyota Corolla, the Elantra further distinguishes itself with a spacious cabin, a lot of standard features for the money, and the longest warranty in the industry. Sadly, it's not offered in a sportier hatchback body style, but the 2023 Hyundai Elantra's many strengths more than make up for that.\n",

The most popular style is the 2.0T SE DSG, which starts at $36,525 and comes with a 2.0L I4 Turbo engine and Front Wheel Drive.

It delivers strong acceleration and handling that's as engaging on the morning commute as on winding back roads. It has an attractive interior with quality details throughout. The top Autobahn trim delivers a true premium experience. Despite this little hatch's compact dimensions, it has a good amount of cargo room, making it a versatile choice. Although there's seating for five, the rear seats aren't particularly spacious; adult passengers won't be happy there for long.\n\nCompetitors include the Subaru WRX, a sporty hatchback with standard all-wheel drive so it's plenty capable when winter weather arrives. The Hyundai Veloster delivers more power than the GTI at a lower price across its lineup. The Honda Civic is available as a sedan or a hatchback that includes the performance-focused Type R, which boasts impressive horsepower.\n",

It lacks some of the refinement of its main rivals, but it's still a comfortable, efficient commuter. The Hyundai Ioniq is a 5-seater vehicle that comes in 7 trim levels. The most popular style is the Hybrid SE, which starts at $26,645 and comes with a Hybrid 1.6L I4 engine and Front Wheel Drive. This Ioniq is estimated to deliver 54 MPG in the city and 57 MPG on the highway.\n\nPros\n\nStandard hybrid and plug-in hybrid options\nExcellent fuel economy\nLong warranty\n\nCons\n\nLess-than-urgent acceleration\nMediocre seats\nOverall Assessment\n\nWith four doors, ample cargo space, and room for five, the 2022 Ioniq is Hyundai's answer to the Toyota Prius. Like its liftback rival, the Ioniq is available as a standard gas-electric hybrid or a plug-in hybrid, which adds a rechargeable battery pack for extended electric-only operation.\n\nTrue to Hyundai's ethos, the Ioniq offers plenty of features at a lower cost than its competitors. Dual automatic climate control, an 8-inch touchscreen, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, and driver aids such as forward-collision warning, automatic emergency braking, and lane-keeping assist are among the standard items on the Blue base model.\n\nAs a hybrid commuter, the Ioniq is a compelling pick. Rated at 59 mpg city/highway combined in the Blue trim, it's possible to make an average round-trip to the office on a single gallon of gas (as always, your mileage may vary). The cabin is quiet, the ride is cushy and composed, and the hatch area provides plenty of cargo space. Road trips are efficient, thanks to a 60-mpg highway rating, but you'll want to keep them infrequent. The Ioniq's thoughtful, comfortable cabin doesn't extend to the seats, which are fine for short trips but grow stiff and shapeless on longer drives.\n\nThe Prius was the original mass-appeal hybrid, and it still casts a long shadow over today's crop. It's also available in standard and plug-in versions, but unlike the Ioniq, it offers optional all-wheel drive. Some buyers will prefer the Ioniq's conventional design to the Prius' more flamboyant and futuristic lines. Other worthy alternatives include the pricier Honda Insight and, if you require all-wheel drive, the Subaru Crosstrek Hybrid and Kia Niro.\n",

It offers up to 70 mpg from its gas engine and a further 80 miles of electric range.

Small trunk.\nOverall Assessment\nCrafted from environmentally sustainable materials and race-themed tech, the Karma GSe-6 is nothing if not unique and full of charisma. Its plug-in hybrid powertrain recharges quickly and offers stellar speed and stopping power. Factoring in its turbocharged engine-turned-generator, the Karma can match full-electric rivals for driving range, though it still requires a stop at the gas pump. The GSe-6 is still far more efficient than your average gas-powered luxury sedan. Cars like that don't come along every day, making the GSe-6 worth a test drive for the right customer.",

It checks all the important boxes — economy, reliability, comfort, safety — that buyers want in a compact car. And the special sauce is the Civic's fun-to-drive nature. From the bottom of the lineup on up, the Civic can put a smile on your face simply by the way it drives. And that's a claim few others in the segment can make.\n\nFor years compact sedans and hatchbacks have been getting bigger, but the new-for-2022 Civic doesn't stretch the envelope much. It's less than 2 inches longer than the previous generation and it is exactly the same height. Those seem to be the right dimensions because most compact cars mimic them almost exactly. Key competitors in the segment include the Toyota Corolla, Nissan Sentra, and Hyundai Elantra. The Asian brands have been so successful, they now have no domestic competitors and only one from Europe: the Volkswagen Jetta. Like its challengers, the Civic will seat five adults but is more comfortable with just four on board. It is currently available as a sedan only, but hatchback and performance models are expected.\n",

And the current version, which first appeared in 2018, is no different. In fact, we think it's better than ever. Some 8 inches longer than its compact sibling, the Honda Civic, the midsize Accord offers sleek styling as well as a spacious, well-appointed cabin with easy-to-use tech and one of the segment's roomiest trunks. But its strongest trait is only apparent once you take it for a spin. Despite its family-car roots, the Accord is truly fun to drive, thanks to a compelling combination of engaging handling, responsive performance, and comfortable ride. The base 1.5-liter engine offers plenty of pep — not to mention good fuel economy — while an optional turbocharged 2.0-liter ups the fun quotient considerably. A fuel-sipping hybrid version is also available. The Accord's ongoing excellence has inspired rivals, such as the Mazda Mazda6 and the Toyota Camry, to up their games, while newcomers, such as the Kia K5 and Hyundai Sonata, also offer strong competition.

Last year a small crossover, the Corolla Cross, adopted the Corolla name, but that is reviewed separately. The sedan offers two gasoline engine choices plus a hybrid version. One of the smallest vehicles in the Toyota lineup, the Corolla fits above the hybrid-only Toyota Prius and below the midsize Toyota Camry. It competes head-to-head with the Nissan Sentra, Honda Civic, Hyundai Elantra, and several other models in one of the industry's largest segments.",

      "name": "2022 Volvo S60 Recharge",
      "description": "Overview\n\nAmple power, style, and luxury make the Volvo S60 Recharge an alternative to the usual European sedans. With a plug-in battery pack helping deliver 415-plus horsepower and 30 mpg, the S60 Recharge is a true unicorn. The Volvo S60 Recharge is a 5-seater vehicle that comes in 4 trim levels. The most popular style is the Inscription, which starts at $51,695 and comes with a Plug-In Hybrid 2.0L I4 S/C and Turbo engine and All Wheel Drive. This S60 Recharge is estimated to deliver 30 MPG combined.\n\nPros\n\nOutstanding cabin comfort and materials\nSwift acceleration\nInnovative safety features\n\nCons\n\nAwkward infotainment interface\nStiff and unnatural braking feel\nOptions add up to a pricey luxury compact\nOverall Assessment\n\nA left-field choice compared to European rivals, the Volvo S60 has quietly built a fanbase with crisp, modern design, interior refinement, and Volvo's dedication to innovative safety features. But the 2022 S60 Recharge stands nearly alone as the only compact luxury sedan available as a plug-in hybrid, offering all the regular model's premium and sporty goodness, but with a side of electric range and added power. The Recharge's only comparable competitor is the BMW 330e, which provides similar gas and electric efficiency, but with BMW's handling and performance abilities.\n\nThe S60 Recharge packs its own punch though, with substantial grip and lively handling afforded by its compact size and standard all-wheel drive. The high-performance Polestar trim delivers even more power and athleticism. The car's meager trunk space hinders utility, although this is endemic to the class; the BMW offers only a bit more cargo capacity. If you need more room, it's worth considering luxury plug-in crossovers such as the Audi Q5 and Lexus NX. The Mini Countryman Cooper SE ALL4 also deserves a mention, with estimated fuel economy of 29 mpg, although its range of 16 electric miles isn't too impressive given its price.\n",

      "name": "2023 Acura Integra",
      "description": "Overview\n\nThe Acura Integra returns to the lineup with a 200-horsepower turbo engine and well-balanced, fun-to-drive chassis. It is the only compact premium car with a versatile liftback body style and engaging six-speed manual transmission. The Acura Integra is a 5-seater vehicle that comes in 3 trim levels. The most popular style is the A-Spec Technology Package Manual, which starts at $36,895 and comes with a 1.5L I4 Turbo engine and Front Wheel Drive. This Integra is estimated to deliver 26 MPG in the city and 36 MPG on the highway.\n\nPros\n\nAffordable and fun to drive\nRoomy cabin with hatchback versatility\nAvailable six-speed manual transmission\n\nCons\n\nElevated road noise\nNo rear-seat air vents\nManual transmission only available on most expensive trim\nOverall Assessment\nBased on the same architecture that underpins the Honda Civic Si, the 2023 Acura Integra revives an epic moniker from the brand's earliest years. The all-new Integra's handsome exterior aligns with the larger Acura TLX sedan, and its spacious cabin provides more rear-seat space than the Audi A3 or Mercedes-Benz CLA 250. The Integra rolls with an eager 200-horsepower 1.5-liter engine and responsive, fun-to-drive chassis. And it offers a pair of features not found in the A3 sedan or CLA 250 four-door coupe: a liftback body with 24.3 cubic-foot of cargo space and an engaging, six-speed manual transmission.",

      "name": "2022 Subaru Legacy",
      "description": "Overview\n\nThe Subaru Legacy has a comfortable interior and a wide range of standard safety and tech features that make it a great choice for families. It is a good value among midsize sedans, especially in its lower trim levels. The Subaru Legacy is a 5-seater vehicle that comes in 6 trim levels. The most popular style is the 2.5i Limited, which starts at $31,440 and comes with a 2.5L H4 engine and All Wheel Drive. This Legacy is estimated to deliver 27 MPG in the city and 35 MPG on the highway.\n\nPros\n\nStandard all-wheel drive\nAffordable starting price\nRemarkably smooth ride\n\nCons\n\nUnimpressive fuel economy\nBland exterior styling\nOverall Assessment\n\nThe Subaru Legacy is a midsize sedan that offers a wide range of trims, a choice of two engines, and a long list of standard features. All Legacy models come with all-wheel drive, making them a favorite among drivers who live in snowy climates. The ride is impressively smooth and quiet, but this isn't a sporty car. Acceleration is modest, especially with the base four-cylinder engine. Still, the Legacy provides the comfort, features, and composed ride that families and commuters will appreciate.\n\nComparatively, the Honda Accord has a roomy interior, more trim levels, and a hybrid model, but no all-wheel drive. The Hyundai Sonata also has more trims but is available only with front-wheel drive. The Kia K5 is an all-new model with either front-wheel or all-wheel drive and sportier handling.\n",

      "name": "2022 Volkswagen Arteon",
      "description": "Overview\n\nA sleek and spacious sedan, the Volkswagen Arteon straddles the line between practicality and luxury. If you want a car that looks expensive and don't need the performance of a true luxury sedan, the Arteon is a satisfying choice. The Volkswagen Arteon is a 5-seater vehicle that comes in 3 trim levels. The most popular style is the SEL R-Line 4MOTION, which starts at $46,845 and comes with a 2.0L I4 Turbo engine and All Wheel Drive. This Arteon is estimated to deliver 22 MPG in the city and 30 MPG on the highway.\n\nPros\n\nCoupe styling with sedan practicality\nSurprising amount of passenger room\nAvailable all-wheel drive\n\nCons\n\nCabin doesn't look as impressive as the exterior\nNot particularly fun to drive\nOverall Assessment\nThe flagship of Volkswagen's sedan lineup, the Arteon is a gracefully styled four-door that looks more like a low-slung coupe. Don't let the looks deceive you, however, as the Arteon is a surprisingly spacious car that comfortably accommodates four adults. It has a hatchback design instead of trunk, so there's plenty of easily accessible cargo space. Like most Volkswagen sedans, the Arteon has a refined, sporty feel thanks to a firm suspension and precise steering. It's no sport sedan, but it's not a cushy cruiser either. The 2022 Arteon gets a new 300-horsepower engine and seven-speed automatic transmission. Front-wheel drive is standard, and all-wheel drive is optional. The interior is well built and attractive, but the materials are not quite up to luxury-brand standards. The touchscreen interface is small compared to rivals' larger, easy-to-read displays. There aren't many direct competitors in this category anymore, but the Acura TLX is worth a look, as well as the Genesis G70.",
