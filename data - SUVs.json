      "description": "Overview\n\nThe redesigned Kia Sportage is a comfortable crossover with a wide range of trims and newly available hybrid models. Its larger size makes it roomier inside, but harder to maneuver in congested urban environments. The Kia Sportage is a 5-seater vehicle that comes in 10 trim levels. The most popular style is the X-Line AWD, which starts at $32,085 and comes with a 2.5L I4 engine and All Wheel Drive. This Sportage is estimated to deliver 23 MPG in the city and 28 MPG on the highway.\n\nPros\n\nNow offers hybrid and plug-in hybrid models\nSpacious cabin and cargo hold\nWell-equipped for the price\n\nCons\n\nLess fuel-efficient than some popular rivals\nBold, new design can be polarizing\nOverall Assessment\n\nThe Kia Sportage is all-new for 2023 with a striking exterior design, increased size, and new hybrid and plug-in hybrid powertrains. There's also a wide range of trims so it's easy to find the right one for your specific needs. The redesigned Sportage combines improved handling that makes it more engaging to drive with an attractive, larger interior. Kia isn't a luxury brand, but it continues to put thoughtfully chosen, high-quality materials into its vehicles, so they look and feel more premium than their prices suggest. Families will appreciate the extra cargo and passenger room, but the larger exterior dimensions mean it's not quite as easy to squeeze into tight parking spots. It's still a compact crossover, but it's now on the upper end of the size range. It has a good amount of standard safety tech and a fully featured infotainment system. All of this, combined with affordable pricing, makes the Kia Sportage a crossover with plenty of appeal.\n\nThe Honda CR-V has comparable pricing with a less intuitive infotainment system and no plug-in hybrid option. The Toyota RAV4 offers three engine variants along with a comprehensive infotainment system and a smooth ride. The Mitsubishi Eclipse Cross is offered only with a gas engine and is more affordable, but not as well-appointed.\n",

Hyundai fixed both issues with the all-new 2022 version. The 2022 Hyundai Tucson is now larger on the inside and more unique on the outside. It delivers comfortable five-passenger seating with plenty of luggage room. While it has some off-road capabilities, the Tucson is far more impressive on the highway and around town, thanks to its smooth ride and precise handling. Although larger than before, the new Tucson is still about the same size as the Honda CR-V and Toyota RAV4. And like its primary competitors, the Tucson now offers both hybrid and plug-in hybrid models that deliver exceptional mileage along with everyday practicality.",

It offers seating for up to seven in a vehicle that's not much larger than popular compact SUVs, such as the Toyota RAV4 and Honda CR-V. Like other Kias, it's loaded with features, including forward-collision warning, automatic emergency braking, and other safety tech as standard equipment.\n\nThe Sorento also comes with a wide variety of available engines, ranging from an economical base four-cylinder to a zippy turbocharged option with nearly 300 horsepower to a highly fuel-efficient hybrid and plug-in hybrid offerings. The latter two are somewhat rare in this category, providing buyers an alternative to more familiar hybrid choices, such as the Toyota Highlander. When outfitted in X-Line trim, which adds all-wheel drive and a host of outdoorsy upgrades, the Sorento gives the Subaru Outback a run for its money. Combine all of that with Kia's best-in-class vehicle warranty, and it's clear why the Sorento stands out in the competitive world of midsize SUVs.\n",

A 3.5-liter V6 again supplies the power but is better mannered with a new smooth-shifting nine-speed automatic transmission. The combination also allows this Pathfinder to tow up to 6,000 pounds. Buyers can choose either front- or all-wheel drive in any of four trim levels. The top-spec Platinum version has some splashy new tech features. But even lesser trims have a nicely finished interior and more space than before, with seating for up to eight. This SUV isn't the biggest family bus, though, nor is it a trail-ready rig.

There are two large touchscreen options for the infotainment system with features that make it easy to operate. In addition to a choice of two gas engines, the NX comes in a hybrid model, and the first-ever Lexus plug-in hybrid with up to 37 miles of all-electric range. Its many possible configurations make it easy to find one that suits your needs, while a modest starting price ensures it will fit your budget, too.\n\nThe Lexus NX's most direct competitors include the Acura RDX, Genesis GV70, and Infiniti QX50.

Though it faces tough competition from some other excellent family haulers — including the Chevrolet Traverse, Honda Pilot, and Toyota Highlander — the Palisade holds its own by offering plush accommodations for up to eight passengers, a highly refined driving demeanor, and a generous array of high-tech features, many of them standard equipment. While it shares a platform with the Kia Telluride, the Palisade takes many of its cues from upscale sister-brand Genesis. It exudes quality and luxury, especially in its top trims, which offer high-end amenities, such as 20-inch wheels, premium leather, ventilated seats, and semi-autonomous driving. Fuel economy from its V6 engine is just middle-of-the-pack, though. Also, the Palisade favors relaxed cruising over spirited performance, so those seeking a more engaging driving experience should consider sportier alternatives, such as the Ford Explorer and Volkswagen Atlas.",

We're not surprised as it offers an excellent overall package: style, comfort, and exceptional value. The 2022 Kia Telluride gets a few minor upgrades, such as a revised grille up front that incorporates Kia's new logo and a larger navigation screen inside. The rest of Kia's largest and most expensive model remains unchanged and for good reason. Its standard 291-horsepower V6 provides excellent all-around performance, and the well-tuned suspension gives it a smooth ride even when loaded up with passengers and cargo. The Telluride also comes with a long list of standard safety features and an interior that looks and feels more expensive than its starting price suggests. If the Telluride's unique styling doesn't appeal to you, it's worth checking out the Hyundai Palisade. Kia and Hyundai are part of the same company, so they share the same engine and suspension. The main difference is the feature content and design with the Palisade leaning toward the more conservative side. Another mainstream option is the Toyota Highlander, which provides a spacious interior, strong safety technology, and an optional hybrid model that delivers excellent fuel economy.

This efficient option provides roughly 40 miles of all-electric driving before it switches over to gas. While you plug-in and charge this SUV just like a fully electric vehicle, it still has that gas engine as backup, so range anxiety is not an issue.

Thanks to a striking redesign last year as well as a notable powertrain overhaul this year, the Rogue has grown far more competitive and now rivals the popular Toyota RAV4 and the Honda CR-V in many areas. Chief among them is the five-seater's handsome interior, which is one of the roomiest in the segment and also one of the best equipped. Even the Rogue's base model includes a generous list of standard active safety tech, while higher trims offer surprisingly high-end touches, such as adaptive cruise control and quilted leather upholstery. While most competitors in this class use four-cylinder power, the Rogue employs a turbocharged three-cylinder engine. Not to worry, though, because it offers similar power to rivals while earning even better fuel economy.

This Range Rover is estimated to deliver 18 MPG in the city and 23 MPG on the highway.\n\nPros\n\nExcellent off-road abilities\nSpacious and elegantly designed interior\nLong-wheelbase models available for additional rear-seat room\n\nCons\n\nLess refined on paved roads than its peers\nFussy infotainment system\nOverall Assessment\nThe Land Rover Range Rover is a luxurious large SUV well equipped to tackle rough terrain. The cabin is roomy and comfortably seats up to five people. All models are decked out in genuine leather upholstery, chrome accents, and wood trim. Even the base model gets heated seats. Upper trims come with massaging front seats, power-reclining rear seats, and an optional refrigerated console. The Range Rover's cargo area has plenty of room for luggage, equipment, or camping gear. If you need a little more room, choose the long-wheelbase model with an additional seven cubic feet of cargo space. Top competitors include the BMW X7, Cadillac Escalade, and Mercedes-Benz GLS, all of which offer sharper handling but less off-road capability.",

      "name": "2022 Toyota Venza",
      "description": "Overview\n\nThe Toyota Venza is a great all-rounder, offering room for five in a stylish, comfortable, safe, and fuel-efficient package. But its relatively high starting price means other models edge it for value. The Toyota Venza is a 5-seater vehicle that comes in 3 trim levels. The most popular style is the Limited AWD, which starts at $41,945 and comes with a Hybrid 2.5L I4 engine and All Wheel Drive. This Venza is estimated to deliver 40 MPG in the city and 37 MPG on the highway.\n\nPros\n\nFuel-efficient hybrid powertrain\nUpscale styling\nTop marks for safety\n\nCons\n\nLess roomy than some competitors\nExpensive for this class\nOverall Assessment\nThe Toyota Venza, a two-row, midsize crossover SUV, debuted last year. If the name sounds familiar, that's because Toyota resurrected it after the prior version was discontinued in 2015. The latest Venza slots between the three-row Highlander and the compact RAV4 in Toyota's SUV lineup. It distinguishes itself with a hybrid-only powertrain and standard all-wheel drive — qualities that give it not only outstanding fuel economy but also sure-footed manners on the road. Inside the cabin, the Venza impresses with high-quality design and materials as well as a generous level of equipment and tech. While there's room for five, the Venza's interior isn't as spacious as some in this class, including the Honda Passport and Jeep Grand Cherokee. In fact, the RAV4 provides about the same amount of passenger room and even more cargo space. Considering that the RAV4 is available with the same fuel-sipping hybrid powertrain at a notably lower starting price, the otherwise excellent Venza loses some of its appeal. Those who don't need a hybrid can find a similar level of space and amenities for less money in the Hyundai Santa Fe and the Kia Sorento.",

      "name": "2022 Jeep Wagoneer",
      "description": "Overview\n\nThe all-new Jeep Wagoneer takes a classic nameplate and applies it to a three-row SUV with seating for eight and a luxurious and spacious interior. When equipped with four-wheel drive, the Wagoneer has more off-road capability than most competitors, but it also commands a considerably higher price tag. The Jeep Wagoneer is a 8-seater vehicle that comes in 6 trim levels. The most popular style is the Series II 4WD, which starts at $73,995 and comes with a 5.7L V8 engine and Four Wheel Drive. This Wagoneer is estimated to deliver 15 MPG in the city and 20 MPG on the highway.\n\nPros\n\nExceptional off-road capability\nSeating for eight\nSmooth ride\n\nCons\n\nMore expensive than class competitors\nLow fuel economy\nOverall Assessment\n\nThe 2022 Jeep Wagoneer marks the return of this iconic SUV to the marketplace and fills an empty spot in the Jeep lineup. It finally gives Jeep fans a three-row option with seating for up to eight passengers in a spacious and comfortable interior. There's also a hefty dose of luxury that includes standard Nappa leather seats and a 10.1-inch infotainment touchscreen. Even the base trim of the Wagoneer delivers a luxury experience. Its standard V8 engine provides ample grunt to get this large SUV up to speed, making the Wagoneer an excellent tow vehicle option. And, since this is a Jeep, it has genuine off-road chops, offering three four-wheel-drive systems with varying degrees of capability.\n\nThe Ford Expedition has a wider range of trims and a more affordable starting price than the Wagoneer, but its interior is not as deluxe. The Chevrolet Tahoe also presents more trims with lower pricing, but again it can't match the Wagoneer's luxurious cabin. The Infiniti QX80 provides three elegant trims with comparable power and higher pricing, but it lacks the same level of off-road ability.\n",

      "name": "2022 Jeep Grand Cherokee",
      "description": "Overview\n\nThe Jeep Grand Cherokee is all-new this year with an updated interior and exterior, an upgraded infotainment system, and more room for cargo. It's a significant redesign that makes this popular SUV an even more compelling choice for buyers who want modern amenities along with classic Jeep styling and capability. The Jeep Grand Cherokee is a 5-seater vehicle that comes in 7 trim levels. The most popular style is the L Limited 4WD, which starts at $50,440 and comes with a 3.6L V6 engine and Four Wheel Drive. This Grand Cherokee is estimated to deliver 18 MPG in the city and 25 MPG on the highway.\n\nPros\n\nOff-road capability\nPowerful engine options\nLuxurious interior\n\nCons\n\nHigh starting price\nMiddling fuel economy\nOverall Assessment\n\nThe Grand Cherokee has long been the go-to SUV for buyers who want a combination of capability, comfort, and luxury. It offers a wide range of trims and multiple four-wheel-drive systems that are ready for off-road adventure. There's also a range of three-row models sold as the Grand Cherokee L, which was introduced last year. That variety makes it easy to find just the right Grand Cherokee for your needs.\n\nPricing climbs quickly for the upper Grand Cherokee models, and there are some lower-priced competitors to consider. The top Grand Cherokee trim breaks $60K, while the nicest Kia Telluride is priced near $45K. The Telluride provides a luxurious cabin with seating for up to eight passengers, but lacks the Jeep's off-road capability. The Toyota Highlander is another eight-passenger option with great reliability and lower pricing but is again less capable off-road. The Land Rover Defender seats five people and has excellent off-road capability, but the base model starts near $54K.\n",

      "name": "2022 Subaru Outback",
      "description": "Overview\n\nWith standard all-wheel drive, impressive ground clearance, and outdoorsy good looks — plus a comfortable ride, roomy interior, and strong fuel economy for its class — the Subaru Outback offers the utility of an SUV with few of the compromises. The Subaru Outback is a 5-seater vehicle that comes in 8 trim levels. The most popular style is the 2.5i Limited, which starts at $35,470 and comes with a 2.5L H4 engine and All Wheel Drive. This Outback is estimated to deliver 26 MPG in the city and 33 MPG on the highway.\n\nPros\n\nMakes a great SUV alternative\nSpacious cabin and cargo area\nHolds its value over time\n\nCons\n\nElectronic driving aids can be annoying\nComplicated touchscreen menus\nNo performance variant\nOverall Assessment\nThe Outback — which is basically a lifted all-wheel-drive wagon — has been a winning formula for Subaru since its debut almost 30 years ago. And the sixth generation, launched in 2020, is no different. But now, in addition to its trail-ready running gear, the Outback offers a fully modern driving experience, with an upscale interior, a suite of standard driving aids, and an available 11.6-inch touchscreen, one of the largest in this segment. It does lack a third row, however. For that, you'll have to look to the larger Subaru Ascent, while the Subaru Forester offers similar capabilities in a slightly smaller and less deluxe package. Though the Outback offers a compliant, car-like ride, you won't mistake it for a sports car. Its standard four-cylinder engine can feel underpowered at times. But, on the plus side, it does achieve better-than-average fuel economy for its class. A peppier turbocharged engine is available, but it comes at a considerably higher price.",
