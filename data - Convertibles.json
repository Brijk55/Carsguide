      "name": "2022 BMW 4 Series",
      "description": "Overview\n\nNewly redesigned last year, the BMW 4 Series continues to offer the kind of performance, handling, and comfort that's expected from luxury performance vehicles in this price range. The BMW 4 Series is a 4-seater vehicle that comes in 2 trim levels. The most popular style is the 430i Convertible RWD, which starts at $54,295 and comes with a 2.0L I4 Turbo engine and Rear Wheel Drive. This 4 Series is estimated to deliver 25 MPG in the city and 34 MPG on the highway.\n\nPros\n\nExceptional all-around performance\nWide variety of configurations to suit any taste\nLuxurious cabin with high-quality materials throughout\n\nCons\n\nCramped backseat in the coupe and convertible\nBlinding interior brightwork\n\nOverall Assessment\n\nCoupes used to be all the rage. Now only a few thousand deals cross the salesman's desk every year. Already susceptible to hot-then-not fashion fatigue, the BMW 4 Series sells half (or less) the volume of the BMW 3 Series sedan upon which it is based. But there is something cool about the cleaner lines of a coupe — or convertible in this case.\n\nCompeting against the clinical Audi A5, stylish Mercedes-Benz C-Class Coupe, swoopy Lexus RC, and slinky Infiniti Q60, the 4 Series has its work cut out for it. But as the most recently redesigned of the bunch, it has an advantage.\n\nBMW has also reintroduced the 4 Series \"Gran Coupe\" to the lineup, a four-door hatchback sedan with a sloping roofline (read: less headroom for the second-row occupants). Body style aside, every 4 Series offers swift acceleration, powerful brakes, and a supple suspension that makes for an enjoyable ride no matter the route.\n",

      "description": "Overview\n\nThree stunning shapes — coupe, convertible, and hatchback — combined with sharp handling and advanced tech make the Audi A5 one of today's best compact sports cars. The Audi A5 is a 4-seater vehicle that comes in 3 trim levels. The most popular style is the Premium Plus Cabriolet 45 TFSI, which starts at $58,195 and comes with a 2.0L I4 Turbo engine and All Wheel Drive. This A5 is estimated to deliver 23 MPG in the city and 31 MPG on the highway.\n\nPros\n\nSporty handling and performance, boosted by standard all-wheel drive\nPremium interior materials\nThree body styles to suit most lifestyles\n\nCons\n\nSome competitors offer more rear passenger room\nScant cargo space in coupe and convertible models\nHefty premium for optional safety features\n\nOverall Assessment\n\nWith high-riding SUVs all the rage these days, Audi is one of the few automakers still in the coupe and convertible game. The 2022 Audi A5 blends the brand's trademarks — style, all-wheel-drive handling, technology — into stunning coupe, convertible, and four-door \"coupe\" shapes. Impeccable cabin design and materials infuse the interior with a luxury feel. Tech and infotainment are rich and full-featured, and while power is modest, the way the A5 slices through turns is joyous.\n\nFor 2022, the A5 adds a handful of upgrades. Android Auto, like Apple CarPlay, is now wireless, freeing the center console of cable spaghetti. A now-standard sport suspension sharpens handling for the coupe and Sportback hatch models. The popular Black Optic Plus appearance package is now available for the base Sportback.\n\nAudi isn't the only brand still bullish on coupes and convertibles, of course. Safe to say that if rivals such as BMW, Mercedes-Benz, and Lexus were not also still invested in two-doors and droptops, Audi's boardroom discussions might find renewed focus. But for now, the A5 remains one of the most refreshing alternatives to boxy sedans, sleepy SUVs, and Jeep-y safari cars.\n",

The BMW Z4 is a 2-seater vehicle that comes in 2 trim levels. The most popular style is the sDriveM40i, which starts at $64,695 and comes with a 3.0L I6 Turbo engine and Rear Wheel Drive.

A rear-wheel-drive two-seat sports car with a folding soft-top roof, the Z4 is all about fun, freedom, and the thrill of the open road, but it's also refined and comfortable. The Z4 offers zesty acceleration and athletic handling. It isn't quite as sporty as its main rival, the Porsche 718 Boxster, but it is a bit more civilized. As a result, the Z4 is more enjoyable in everyday driving than the sportier Porsche. And it's considerably less expensive. The Z4 is also more affordable than the Audi TT, which comes standard with all-wheel drive. That's not available on the BMW or the Porsche. And if you're looking for a Z4-like coupe, consider the Toyota GR Supra. They look nothing alike, but they were co-developed by the two automakers and share basically everything, including their engines.",

Some of the tech is hard to use, and the options list gets confusing, yet we still consider it one of the best luxury vehicles in its class. The Mercedes-Benz E-Class is a 4-seater vehicle that comes in 3 trim levels. The most popular style is the AMG E 53 Cabriolet 4MATIC+, which starts at $85,400 and comes with a 3.0L I6 S/C and Turbo engine and All Wheel Drive.

Each vehicle in the E-Class lineup sets a high standard of excellence by which competitive cars are judged. The E-Class balances leading-edge technology with traditional automotive luxury in a manner that others find difficult to counter. And it does so in sedan, coupe, and wagon body styles that give it a level of flexibility that's rare in the class. All the E-Class variants share common attributes that include classic luxury, innovative technology, rock-solid build quality, and impressive safety. Its rear-drive layout enables the sedan to provide better handling than a front-drive car. While the standard E-Class models offer plenty of driving pleasure, the sport-oriented AMG versions take the driving experience to a higher level.\n\nThe E-Class sedan is in the middle of its competitive set in terms of size. It is 1.5 inches shorter than the BMW 5 Series and on par with the Audi A6. The Cadillac CT5 — the only domestic luxury sedan that competes with the E-Class — is half an inch shorter. The visually stunning E-Class coupe is 4 inches shorter than the sedan.\n",

      "name": "2022 Ford Mustang",
      "description": "Overview\n\nThe Ford Mustang still clings to its original formula: a highly styled two-door that puts racing looks and performance ahead of everyday practicality. Among current performance cars, the iconic Mustang is a bargain. The Ford Mustang is a 4-seater vehicle that comes in 6 trim levels. The most popular style is the GT Premium Convertible, which starts at $49,460 and comes with a 5.0L V8 engine and Rear Wheel Drive. This Mustang is estimated to deliver 15 MPG in the city and 24 MPG on the highway.\n\nPros\n\nWide model range offers a Mustang for every type of buyer\nComfortable front seats\nAvailable as a coupe or convertible\n\nCons\n\nV8s are thirsty for fuel\nSmall backseat\n\nOverall Assessment\n\nMore than 60 years ago, the Ford Mustang was created with a magic formula that has served it well. It's always been a front-engine, rear-wheel-drive two-door with sporty bucket seats and a small backseat. With a long hood and short rear deck, the Mustang looks powerful and sporty, even in base-level trims. Ford has recently dropped most of its car line, leaving just the Mustang and specialty Ford GT among a host of SUVs and pickup trucks.\n\nFor 2022, Ford is bypassing major changes to the Mustang in favor of freshening the lineup with five new special-edition models. The Mustang is one of those rare vehicles that can justify a very wide price spread. A basic Mustang EcoBoost Fastback has a starting price of just over $28,000, while the Shelby GT500 has a base price of more than $70,000. Options can push that price to about $100,000.\n\nIn this era of crossover dominance, the Mustang has only two head-to-head competitors. The Chevrolet Camaro is most similar to the Mustang, and versions of both compete in NASCAR. The Dodge Challenger has a similar vibe but is larger than the Ford. In overall length, the Mustang is the same size as the Camaro but almost 10 inches shorter than the Challenger. The Mustang and Camaro are available in coupe and convertible versions, while the Challenger is only offered as a coupe.\n",

Exhilarating performance, striking styling, and modern technology make the big coupe fun to drive. But it is less enjoyable for daily errands thanks to its small cabin and tiny trunk. The Chevrolet Camaro is a 4-seater vehicle that comes in 8 trim levels. The most popular style is the Convertible LT1, which starts at $41,395 and comes with a 6.2L V8 engine and Rear Wheel Drive. This Camaro is estimated to deliver 16 MPG in the city and 24 MPG on the highway.\n\nPros\n\nDistinctive exterior styling\nExcellent infotainment system\nImpressive performance\n\nCons\n\nTight interior\nMiniscule trunk\nElectronic driver aids limited to upper trims\n\nOverall Assessment\n\nAvailable as a two-door coupe or two-door convertible, the 2022 Chevrolet Camaro is the latest edition of a model that dates back to the halcyon days of the 1960s. Not only was Flower Power all the rage, but sporty youth-oriented cars such as the Camaro were taking the market by storm. The Ford Mustang started the craze, but the Chevy Camaro was a fast follower and gave the Mustang a run for its money. Fifty years later, the American car market has changed, but the basic Camaro concept remains. The car is still a high-style rear-drive two-door that delivers sporty performance. Further, it is available in several variations — not only convertible and coupe but also with a bevy of engine choices.\n\nThe bedrock engine for the Camaro remains a big-displacement V8. Space efficiency was never one of the Camaro's strong suits, and that remains so today. The vehicle is a classic \"2+2\" designed to provide excellent accommodations for driver and front-seat passenger with rear seats that can hold two others in a pinch. The Camaro offers a large portion of driving fun even in its least performance-oriented trim. And at the top of the lineup, it provides performance only a handful of cars can match.\n\nIn terms of size, the Chevy Camaro and the Mustang are identical. The Camaro's other direct competitor is the Dodge Challenger, another highly styled two-door coupe. But the Challenger is almost 10 inches longer than the Camaro and offers a much more usable rear seat.\n",

It's quick, agile, and good-looking. More importantly it's a convertible, and there aren't many well-priced droptops left. With rear-wheel drive, a manual transmission, and a smooth, powerful engine, it's fun to drive, yet practical enough to be enjoyed everyday. No wonder it's one of the best-selling sports cars of all time.\n\nThe Miata is available in two styles: a traditional soft top convertible and the RF, which features a power-retractable roof panel. The standard cloth soft top can be lowered with one hand in a matter of seconds. The cabin is tight but comfortable. More interior storage space would be nice, but the Miata's small trunk is large enough to be useful for shopping bags or an overnight duffle bag. The suspension is very well-tuned, providing sports-car handling and a surprisingly smooth ride. There is no direct competitor for the Miata. The Ford Mustang and Chevrolet Camaro convertibles are much bigger. The BMW Z4 and Porsche 718 Boxster droptops are much more expensive. The Toyota GR 86 and Subaru BRZ coupes don't offer a convertible option.\n",

The most popular style is the LC 500 Convertible, which starts at $102,125 and comes with a 5.0L V8 engine and Rear Wheel Drive.

Dressed in the finest materials, its cabin is as plush as it gets. And its potent, standard V8 (a fuel-efficient hybrid powertrain is also offered) is a good match for the car's smooth handling and refined road manners.\n\nOn a less positive note, the Lexus LC isn't exactly brimming with utility. Other picks in this class have much more room for cargo; for example, the BMW 8 Series has more than twice as much cargo space as the LC. And if you're looking for a car that emphasizes athleticism, rival models like the Jaguar F-Type are more track-focused and spirited. Still, the swanky LC is a top choice if you need a high-end sports car that emphasizes style, luxury, and comfort.\n",

It continues to lead the industry with a unique combination of breathtaking performance, civility, and comfort that can be enjoyed every day, in all four seasons.

Rear-wheel-drive and all-wheel-drive models are also available, and Porsche still offers some variants with a clutch pedal and an excellent seven-speed manual transmission. Most, however, are sold with Porsche's PDK automatic, which is considered the best dual-clutch gearbox available. Its desirability continues with its iconic design, modern interior, exceptional build quality, and back seat.

The secret to its success is a redesigned chassis and mid-engine layout. The Corvette is pleasant enough to drive that it can be used daily, with a spacious cabin and pliant ride.

The BMW 8 Series is a 4-seater vehicle that comes in 3 trim levels.

A decadent interior completes the package as the cabin of the 8 Series is a step above the average luxury car. From the sleek design to the feel of the materials, every element of the 8 Series looks expensive. The only obvious flaw to the 8 Series is its size, as the rear seats in the coupe and convertible models are too small for adults.

It captivated enthusiasts with its tidy proportions, clean style, and a highly crafted interior. Now in its third generation, the current TT is still inspired by that very first model. And it has evolved in much the same way as the Porsche 911. The TT is handsome inside and out. Plus it offers a ride-and-handling balance skewed toward comfort. It's a car that's easy to live with.\n\nShopping for a TT is easy—there's just one engine and transmission choice: a 228-horsepower turbocharged four-cylinder mated to a dual-clutch automatic. And every TT is built with all-wheel drive. That really sets it apart from competitors as a true all-season sports car.\n\nThe TT is available as a coupe or a drop-top roadster with a full-power fabric roof and electronically adjustable wind deflector. We particularly like the roadster's silver metal roll hoops.\n\nThe TT is plenty quick. But to keep up with the higher powered optional engines from BMW and Porsche, you'll want to look at Audi's more powerful TTS or the nearly 400-horsepower TT RS. Most buyers will find the TT and TTS deliver enough excitement.\n\nAudi has paired the TT to one basic trim, and just about everything comes standard. That contrasts with the Porsche 718 Cayman, whose many optional features drastically run up the sticker price.\n",

That it's also one of the automaker's least-expensive models is icing on the cake. The Porsche 718 Boxster is a 2-seater vehicle that comes in 6 trim levels. The most popular style is the S Roadster, which starts at $75,950 and comes with a 2.5L H4 Turbo engine and Rear Wheel Drive. This 718 Boxster is estimated to deliver 19 MPG in the city and 24 MPG on the highway.\n\nPros\n\nSharp handling and design\nAvailable flat-six engine delivers intoxicating power and sound\n\nCons\n\nMinimalist cabin lacks storage and high-tech features\nPrice goes up fast with options\nOverall Assessment\nThe 718 Boxster is Porsche's entry-level sports car. The drop-top two-seater shares its mid-engine platform and drivetrain with the Porsche 718 Cayman coupe. Both models rival the iconic Porsche 911 for driving engagement, despite costing tens of thousands less. That's thanks largely to the ideal weight balance provided by mounting its engine amidships, which not only helps the 718 Boxster achieve supercar-like agility but also delivers arias of internal-combustion music directly to your ears. Power is ample from the turbocharged four-cylinder engine, which is available in 2.0- and 2.5-liter versions making 300 and 350 horsepower, respectively. But the real magic comes from the optional 4.0-liter flat-six. It produces a generous 394 hp and sounds positively Wagnerian when revving to its 7800-rpm redline. Either mill can be fitted with a six-speed manual gearbox or Porsche's excellent seven-speed dual-clutch automatic (known as PDK). Inside the 718 Boxster, you'll find ample room for two. But that's about it. There's very little in the way of storage, and the otherwise high-quality cabin lacks much in the way of features — that is, until you start adding items from the (long) list of options. But we suspect that won't upset most buyers. After all, the point of the 718 Boxster is to thrill its occupants, not pamper them.",

      "name": "2022 Audi R8",
      "description": "Overview\n\nThe 2022 Audi R8 offers an intoxicating mix of supercar performance, sheer power, and eye-catching design combined with daily civility. It's a great choice for drivers who want to enjoy their supercar every day of the week. The Audi R8 is a 2-seater vehicle that comes in 2 trim levels. The most popular style is the V10 Spyder RWD, which starts at $162,395 and comes with a 5.2L V10 engine and Rear Wheel Drive. This R8 is estimated to deliver 14 MPG in the city and 23 MPG on the highway.\n\nPros\n\nSupercar looks and speed\nAll-wheel-drive security\nComfortable enough for everyday driving\n\nCons\n\nMinimal cargo space\nDoesn't deliver the power and handling of some rivals\nOverall Assessment\nA six-figure two-seat mid-engine supercar with over 600 horsepower, the Audi R8 lives at the top of the Audi food chain. Supercars are all about sex appeal and speed, and the R8 delivers, rocketing from zero to60 mph in 3.6 seconds or less. It's thrilling to drive, and unlike some of its rivals, it's available with all-wheel drive. That adds some security to its handling, especially on wet roads. The R8, which is available as a two-seat coupe or convertible, is also civilized enough to drive daily thanks to a surprisingly roomy interior and brilliantly tuned suspension that provides a refined ride quality. Given the current state of high-performance car prices, the Audi R8 is also a bargain. Many rivals — such as the McLaren GT, Lamborghini Huracan Evo, and Ferrari F8 Tributo — cost considerably more. Even the Porsche 911 Turbo and Acura NSX Type S have higher base prices. The Chevrolet Corvette has the lowest horsepower rating and price of the pack.",

      "name": "2023 MINI Convertible",
      "description": "Overview\n\nThe Mini Convertible blends the fun of top-down driving with powerful engines and crisp handling. It's a joy on twisting country roads and easy to navigate through urban areas, too. However, it has a tight rear seat and minimal cargo room. The MINI Convertible is a 4-seater vehicle that comes in 3 trim levels. The most popular style is the Convertible S, which starts at $36,750 and comes with a 2.0L I4 Turbo engine and Front Wheel Drive. This Convertible is estimated to deliver 27 MPG in the city and 36 MPG on the highway.\n\nPros\n\nStandout styling\nEngaging drive\nPowerful engines\n\nCons\n\nTight rear seats\nModest cargo capacity\nAll-wheel drive is not available\n\nOverall Assessment\n\nThe Mini Convertible has seating for four people plus the sporty drive and undeniably cute styling of the Mini Hardtop. Its small dimensions mean there's not much room for cargo, and the rear seats are only suitable for younger kids. That's okay, though, because you don't buy a cute little convertible for its practicality. You buy a car like this for the fun factor, and the Mini Convertible delivers with responsive handling and powerful engines. The interior's visual appeal matches the car's attractive exterior. This isn't the roomiest convertible you can buy, but it's easily one of the most fun to drive; it will put a smile on your face whenever you see it in your driveway.\n\nThe Mazda MX-5 Miata also has attractive styling but seats only two people. The BMW Z4 is sleeker and more refined, with a focus on luxury performance. The Audi TT has a smooth ride and a beautiful and comfortable interior.\n",
