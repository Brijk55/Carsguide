      "description": "Overview\n\nThe redesigned Kia Sportage is a comfortable crossover with a wide range of trims and newly available hybrid models. Its larger size makes it roomier inside, but harder to maneuver in congested urban environments. The Kia Sportage is a 5-seater vehicle that comes in 10 trim levels. The most popular style is the Hybrid LX FWD, which starts at $28,585 and comes with a Hybrid 1.6L I4 Turbo engine and Front Wheel Drive. This Sportage is estimated to deliver 42 MPG in the city and 44 MPG on the highway.\n\nPros\n\nNow offers hybrid and plug-in hybrid models\nSpacious cabin and cargo hold\nWell-equipped for the price\n\nCons\n\nLess fuel-efficient than some popular rivals\nBold, new design can be polarizing\nOverall Assessment\n\nThe Kia Sportage is all-new for 2023 with a striking exterior design, increased size, and new hybrid and plug-in hybrid powertrains. There's also a wide range of trims so it's easy to find the right one for your specific needs. The redesigned Sportage combines improved handling that makes it more engaging to drive with an attractive, larger interior. Kia isn't a luxury brand, but it continues to put thoughtfully chosen, high-quality materials into its vehicles, so they look and feel more premium than their prices suggest. Families will appreciate the extra cargo and passenger room, but the larger exterior dimensions mean it's not quite as easy to squeeze into tight parking spots. It's still a compact crossover, but it's now on the upper end of the size range. It has a good amount of standard safety tech and a fully featured infotainment system. All of this, combined with affordable pricing, makes the Kia Sportage a crossover with plenty of appeal.\n\nThe Honda CR-V has comparable pricing with a less intuitive infotainment system and no plug-in hybrid option. The Toyota RAV4 offers three engine variants along with a comprehensive infotainment system and a smooth ride. The Mitsubishi Eclipse Cross is offered only with a gas engine and is more affordable, but not as well-appointed.\n",

New styling plus a variety of features combine with a lengthy warranty to appeal to a wide range of buyers. The Hyundai Tucson is a 5-seater vehicle that comes in 10 trim levels. The most popular style is the Hybrid SEL Convenience AWD, which starts at $33,645 and comes with a Hybrid 1.6L I4 Turbo engine and All Wheel Drive.

Hyundai fixed both issues with the all-new 2022 version. The 2022 Hyundai Tucson is now larger on the inside and more unique on the outside. It delivers comfortable five-passenger seating with plenty of luggage room. While it has some off-road capabilities, the Tucson is far more impressive on the highway and around town, thanks to its smooth ride and precise handling. Although larger than before, the new Tucson is still about the same size as the Honda CR-V and Toyota RAV4. And like its primary competitors, the Tucson now offers both hybrid and plug-in hybrid models that deliver exceptional mileage along with everyday practicality.",

It offers seating for up to seven in a vehicle that's not much larger than popular compact SUVs, such as the Toyota RAV4 and Honda CR-V. Like other Kias, it's loaded with features, including forward-collision warning, automatic emergency braking, and other safety tech as standard equipment.\n\nThe Sorento also comes with a wide variety of available engines, ranging from an economical base four-cylinder to a zippy turbocharged option with nearly 300 horsepower to a highly fuel-efficient hybrid and plug-in hybrid offerings. The latter two are somewhat rare in this category, providing buyers an alternative to more familiar hybrid choices, such as the Toyota Highlander. When outfitted in X-Line trim, which adds all-wheel drive and a host of outdoorsy upgrades, the Sorento gives the Subaru Outback a run for its money. Combine all of that with Kia's best-in-class vehicle warranty, and it's clear why the Sorento stands out in the competitive world of midsize SUVs.\n",

The suspension has been modified to improve the ride quality, and the all-new infotainment system with a massive available touchscreen is more responsive. There are six trims, rear-wheel or four-wheel drive, two cabs, and three-bed lengths. Its breadth of options make it versatile enough to work for family life or work life. But it still doesn't have quite the range of configurations as its competitors. The interior is also improved with better materials and more comfortable seating to match the Tundra's smoother ride. The Ram 1500 has a superior ride with more trims and more available engines. The Ford F-150 boasts the highest towing and payload rating in the segment. The Chevrolet Silverado 1500 offers more engines and more trims in its lineup but a less appealing interior.",

The 2021 makeover gave the latest Sienna a sleeker exterior than the preceding third-gen \"swagger wagon\" and a more aerodynamic design that makes the large people-mover more fuel efficient. To make the Sienna even more of a fuel-sipper, it's only available with a four-cylinder hybrid powertrain, which replaced the previous version's V6 and traded performance for fuel efficiency. Along with the Chrysler Pacifica, the Sienna remains one of only two minivans available with all-wheel drive. The Sienna boasts one of the most modern and refined interiors in the class, and available second-row captain's chairs with fold-out leg rests provide a luxurious, limo-like feel. But while cargo space with all seats occupied is near the top in the segment, Sienna's maximum cargo volume isn't on par with the competition.",

It lacks some of the refinement of its main rivals, but it's still a comfortable, efficient commuter. The Hyundai Ioniq is a 5-seater vehicle that comes in 7 trim levels. The most popular style is the Hybrid SE, which starts at $26,645 and comes with a Hybrid 1.6L I4 engine and Front Wheel Drive.

Like its liftback rival, the Ioniq is available as a standard gas-electric hybrid or a plug-in hybrid, which adds a rechargeable battery pack for extended electric-only operation.\n\nTrue to Hyundai's ethos, the Ioniq offers plenty of features at a lower cost than its competitors. Dual automatic climate control, an 8-inch touchscreen, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, and driver aids such as forward-collision warning, automatic emergency braking, and lane-keeping assist are among the standard items on the Blue base model.\n\nAs a hybrid commuter, the Ioniq is a compelling pick. Rated at 59 mpg city/highway combined in the Blue trim, it's possible to make an average round-trip to the office on a single gallon of gas (as always, your mileage may vary). The cabin is quiet, the ride is cushy and composed, and the hatch area provides plenty of cargo space. Road trips are efficient, thanks to a 60-mpg highway rating, but you'll want to keep them infrequent. The Ioniq's thoughtful, comfortable cabin doesn't extend to the seats, which are fine for short trips but grow stiff and shapeless on longer drives.\n\nThe Prius was the original mass-appeal hybrid, and it still casts a long shadow over today's crop. It's also available in standard and plug-in versions, but unlike the Ioniq, it offers optional all-wheel drive. Some buyers will prefer the Ioniq's conventional design to the Prius' more flamboyant and futuristic lines. Other worthy alternatives include the pricier Honda Insight and, if you require all-wheel drive, the Subaru Crosstrek Hybrid and Kia Niro.\n",

If the name sounds familiar, that's because Toyota resurrected it after the prior version was discontinued in 2015. The latest Venza slots between the three-row Highlander and the compact RAV4 in Toyota's SUV lineup. It distinguishes itself with a hybrid-only powertrain and standard all-wheel drive — qualities that give it not only outstanding fuel economy but also sure-footed manners on the road. Inside the cabin, the Venza impresses with high-quality design and materials as well as a generous level of equipment and tech. While there's room for five, the Venza's interior isn't as spacious as some in this class, including the Honda Passport and Jeep Grand Cherokee. In fact, the RAV4 provides about the same amount of passenger room and even more cargo space. Considering that the RAV4 is available with the same fuel-sipping hybrid powertrain at a notably lower starting price, the otherwise excellent Venza loses some of its appeal. Those who don't need a hybrid can find a similar level of space and amenities for less money in the Hyundai Santa Fe and the Kia Sorento.",

And the current version, which first appeared in 2018, is no different. In fact, we think it's better than ever. Some 8 inches longer than its compact sibling, the Honda Civic, the midsize Accord offers sleek styling as well as a spacious, well-appointed cabin with easy-to-use tech and one of the segment's roomiest trunks.

The Accord's ongoing excellence has inspired rivals, such as the Mazda Mazda6 and the Toyota Camry, to up their games, while newcomers, such as the Kia K5 and Hyundai Sonata, also offer strong competition. But the Accord remains the benchmark in this class.",

      "name": "2022 Toyota Camry",
      "description": "Overview\n\nThe Toyota Camry is a fuel-efficient and roomy sedan that easily accommodates five adults. Its wide variety of trims range from luxurious to sporty. But the trunk is only average, and its base engine is underpowered. The Toyota Camry is a 5-seater vehicle that comes in 13 trim levels. The most popular style is the Hybrid SE CVT FWD, which starts at $30,540 and comes with a Hybrid 2.5L I4 engine and Front Wheel Drive. This Camry is estimated to deliver 44 MPG in the city and 47 MPG on the highway.\n\nPros\n\nRoomy interior\nWide range of trim levels\nHybrid offers excellent mileage\n\nCons\n\nUnimpressive base engine\nAverage trunk space\nOverall Assessment\n\nThe 2022 Toyota Camry is a midsize sedan with plenty of room for five passengers. It has something for everyone with 13 trims that include two gas engines, a hybrid engine, and a choice of front-wheel or all-wheel drive. No matter which you choose, the Camry is focused on passenger comfort with a welcoming interior swathed in attractive materials throughout. While some sedans have minimal rear-seat room, the Camry can comfortably seat three adults back there. It boasts a wide range of standard safety features along with a comprehensive infotainment system. Downsides are an underpowered base engine and a small trunk that makes it difficult to accommodate luggage for those five adults.\n\nOther popular choices in the midsize-sedan segment include the Nissan Altima, Honda Accord, and Hyundai Sonata. The Altima has fewer trims with similar pricing and a less powerful engine. The Accord provides better fuel economy and more room for cargo. The Sonata has similar pricing and a lineup that includes both gas and hybrid engines.\n",

      "name": "2022 Lexus ES",
      "description": "Overview\n\nSmooth-riding and exceptionally quiet, the Lexus ES midsize luxury sedan makes the daily commute feel relaxing. Its performance isn't exciting, but it's a top choice if you want a reliable, well-equipped, comfortable luxury sedan. The Lexus ES is a 5-seater vehicle that comes in 12 trim levels. The most popular style is the ES 300h FWD, which starts at $43,225 and comes with a Hybrid 2.5L I4 engine and Front Wheel Drive. This ES is estimated to deliver 43 MPG in the city and 44 MPG on the highway.\n\nPros\n\nSerene cabin and comfortable ride\nHybrid model delivers impressive fuel economy\nAvailable all-wheel drive\n\nCons\n\nNot very exciting to drive, even with upgraded F Sport trim\nTrunk is on the small side\nAll-wheel drive is only available with a four-cylinder engine\nOverall Assessment\n\nAs SUVs continue to dominate the luxury market, sedans like the Lexus ES are becoming a rare breed. A true midsize sedan that can seat five comfortably, the ES leaves performance goals to its European competitors. This Lexus is designed for quiet comfort above all else. The spacious interior features top-quality materials and a user-friendly design; a new touchscreen infotainment screen rectifies a previous shortcoming. The popular V6 model offers strong acceleration and smooth shifts while the hybrid delivers impressive mileage. All-wheel drive is available for those who need all-weather traction, but it's paired with a less powerful four-cylinder engine.\n\nThe closest competitors to the Lexus ES are the Acura TLX and Genesis G80. The TLX is similar in size and price, but it has a sportier look and feel. The G80 matches the ES' luxury and passenger accommodations, but it doesn't offer a hybrid model.\n",

      "name": "2022 Ford F-150",
      "description": "Overview\n\nThe Ford F-150 holds the title of best-selling full-size truck largely due to its multiple trims, wide range of configurations, and high tow rating. It doesn't ride as smoothly as some rivals, but the F-150 is still a top contender among pickups. The Ford F-150 is a 5-seater vehicle that comes in 8 trim levels. The most popular style is the XLT SuperCrew 5.5' Box 4WD, which starts at $49,770 and comes with a 3.3L V6 engine and Four Wheel Drive. This F-150 is estimated to deliver 19 MPG in the city and 22 MPG on the highway.\n\nPros\n\nImpressive towing and payload\nWide range of trims\nMultiple engines\n\nCons\n\nNo diesel engine option\nPricing climbs quickly\nOverall Assessment\nThe Ford F-150 has long sat at the top of the full-size pickup truck segment. Its capability is unrivaled, boasting the highest towing and payload ratings of any full-size light-duty truck. A fuel-efficient hybrid is available, and the new electric F-150 Lightning (reviewed separately) hits showrooms this spring. The choices continue with rear-wheel or four-wheel drive, three bed lengths, and three cab configurations. The competition is fierce from popular alternatives such as the Ram 1500, which has a smoother ride and more attractive interior, and the Chevrolet Silverado 1500 with its multifunction tailgate. There's also the Toyota Tundra if you're looking for similar features at a lower price.",

      "description": "Overview\n\nBasically, the Honda Insight is a Honda Civic Hybrid, and that's a good thing. This compact sedan offers a spacious interior, delivers incredible fuel economy, and is the most fun to drive of the hybrids in its price range. The Honda Insight is a 5-seater vehicle that comes in 2 trim levels. The most popular style is the EX, which starts at $26,855 and comes with a Hybrid 1.5L I4 engine and Front Wheel Drive. This Insight is estimated to deliver 55 MPG in the city and 49 MPG on the highway.\n\nPros\n\nExcellent fuel economy\nFun to drive\nRoomy interior\n\nCons\n\nInfotainment systems can be challenging to operate\nWould be more useful as a hatchback\nOverall Assessment\nThe 2022 Honda Insight is the most enjoyable-to-drive hybrid sedan in its class, which includes the Toyota Prius. Insight delivers about as much performance and overall verve as the extremely popular Honda Civic, and like the Civic, it will transport five passengers in comfort. The Insight also delivers incredible fuel economy. That's a nifty trick considering its character and performance. Rivals include the slightly shorter Toyota Corolla Hybrid and Prius, and the slightly longer Hyundai Elantra Hybrid. Fun, efficient, and spacious, the Insight is a wise buy for singles, couples, and even families with small children.",

      "name": "2022 Toyota RAV4",
      "description": "Overview\n\nWith its wide variety of trim levels, numerous features, and multiple hybrid options, the Toyota RAV4 gives buyers plenty of reasons for consideration. It's not the most fun-to-drive compact SUV, but for just about everything else, the RAV4 is at the top of the class. The Toyota RAV4 is a 5-seater vehicle that comes in 12 trim levels. The most popular style is the Hybrid XLE Premium AWD, which starts at $35,150 and comes with a Hybrid 2.5L I4 engine and All Wheel Drive. This RAV4 is estimated to deliver 41 MPG in the city and 38 MPG on the highway.\n\nPros\n\nImpressive standard safety items\nHybrid and plug-in hybrid versions\nExcellent resale value\n\nCons\n\nBasic infotainment system\nGas engine can be noisy\nOverall Assessment\n\nThe five-passenger Toyota RAV4 gives most buyers looking for a compact crossover exactly what they want: reliable, versatile transportation. Positioned above the C-HR and below the Highlander in Toyota's lineup, the RAV4 shares some styling details with Toyota's rugged 4Runner SUV and Tacoma pickup. But it delivers a far cushier ride. That's a trade-off most RAV4 buyers heartily endorse.\n\nThe RAV4's wide variety of models is one of the reasons for its ongoing success. It offers gas-powered trims, an exceptionally fuel-efficient hybrid model, a plug-in hybrid with 42 miles of all-electric range, and even a TRD Off-Road model. Plus every RAV4 is equipped with a long list of active safety features such as automatic emergency braking and adaptive cruise control. Its most direct competitor, the Honda CR-V, is about the same size but has fewer variations. The Jeep Cherokee has better off-road credentials, but the RAV4's Adventure and TRD Off-Road trims are solid competitors. Another key rival, the Nissan Rogue, prefers to stay on the pavement.\n",
