      "name": "2022 Toyota Sienna",
      "description": "Overview\n\nThe 2022 Toyota Sienna gains a new camping-oriented trim and carries over the sleeker styling, more modern interior, and increased fuel efficiency from the 2021 model year's complete overhaul, making it a top pick among minivans. The Toyota Sienna is a 7-seater vehicle that comes in 6 trim levels. The most popular style is the LE 8-Passenger FWD, which starts at $36,500 and comes with a Hybrid 2.5L I4 engine and Front Wheel Drive. This Sienna is estimated to deliver 36 MPG in the city and 36 MPG on the highway.\n\nPros\n\nClass-leading fuel economy\nLuxury-like interior\nNew outdoorsy trim\n\nCons\n\nLess cargo space than some competitors\nHybrid powertrain provides less performance\nOverall Assessment\nComing off a total redesign for the 2021 model year, the 2022 Toyota Sienna adds a new grade and a couple of upgrades to existing trims. The 2021 makeover gave the latest Sienna a sleeker exterior than the preceding third-gen \"swagger wagon\" and a more aerodynamic design that makes the large people-mover more fuel efficient. To make the Sienna even more of a fuel-sipper, it's only available with a four-cylinder hybrid powertrain, which replaced the previous version's V6 and traded performance for fuel efficiency. Along with the Chrysler Pacifica, the Sienna remains one of only two minivans available with all-wheel drive. The Sienna boasts one of the most modern and refined interiors in the class, and available second-row captain's chairs with fold-out leg rests provide a luxurious, limo-like feel. But while cargo space with all seats occupied is near the top in the segment, Sienna's maximum cargo volume isn't on par with the competition.",

      "name": "2023 Kia Carnival",
      "description": "Overview\n\nThe Kia Carnival may be the successor to the Sedona, but it's a dramatic departure from any other minivan on the road. Camouflaged to look like an SUV, the Carnival conceals all the strengths of a van, packed with seating for eight, a flat floor, innumerable storage compartments, and dual sliding doors. All-wheel drive isn't available, nor is a hybrid, but Kia's 290-horsepower V6 is sporty and refined, helping the Carnival get where it's going, on time and in style. The Kia Carnival is a 8-seater vehicle that comes in 5 trim levels. The most popular style is the LX, which starts at $33,935 and comes with a 3.5L V6 engine and Front Wheel Drive. This Carnival is estimated to deliver 19 MPG in the city and 26 MPG on the highway.\n\nPros\n\nSUV looks, minivan practicality. Roomy and refined cabin. Easily converts into a cargo vehicle. Modern tech for a low price.\n\nCons\n\nSome rivals get better mileage. All-wheel drive isn't an option.\nOverall Assessment\nThe Kia Carnival is an excellent choice for minivan drivers who don't want to appear like they are driving a minivan. Kia's SUVs influence the exterior design, while the cabin feels surprisingly sporty, intimate, and un-van-like. Yet, Kia's 'multi-purpose vehicle' includes best-in-class passenger and cargo volume compared to other minivans. Though its front-wheel-drive platform lacks an SUV's ruggedness, a flat floor provides roominess most sport utilities cannot match. And while its only engine choice is not the most economical one you can buy, it is quiet, forceful, and even offers 3,500 lbs of towing. Kia stays competitive with rivals by including driver safety aids, impressive infotainment features, and class-leading warranty coverage. The Carnival is not for everyone, and some shoppers will prefer more conventional and affordable options. But it successfully bridges the gap between versatility, interior space, and style, breathing new life into the minivan segment.",

      "name": "2022 Chrysler Pacifica",

It also offers all-wheel drive and is the only minivan available as a fuel-sipping plug-in hybrid. The Chrysler Pacifica is a 7-seater vehicle that comes in 7 trim levels. The most popular style is the Touring L FWD, which starts at $42,720 and comes with a 3.6L V6 engine and Front Wheel Drive. This Pacifica is estimated to deliver 19 MPG in the city and 28 MPG on the highway.\n\nPros\n\nOffers the only plug-in hybrid powertrain in the class\nSmooth ride\nHuge interior is \"library\" quiet\n\nCons\n\nNo all-wheel drive with the plug-in hybrid powertrain\nHigher base price than some key rivals\nOverall Assessment\nWhen it comes to interior space, features, and functionality for the family, it's hard to beat a minivan. And when it comes to minivans, it's hard to beat the Chrysler Pacifica. One of the best sellers in its class, the Pacifica is extremely roomy with seating for up to eight passengers. It's also luxurious, especially in the upper trim levels. Cargo space? More than most families will ever need. And the Pacifica features Stow 'n Go second-row seats that fold into the floor to maximize cargo capacity. It's powered by a 3.6-liter V6 and a smooth-shifting nine-speed automatic transmission. The Pacifica isn't exactly sporty, but it's quick enough to easily ramp up to freeway traffic. It's also available with all-wheel drive, which is rare in the minivan class. The Toyota Sienna is the only competitor to offer it. The Pacifica is also the only minivan that's available as a plug-in hybrid with an all-electric range of more than 30 miles and a total range of 500 miles-plus.",

      "description": "Overview\n\nThe Chrysler Voyager meets the needs of budget-conscious minivan shoppers. It's supremely affordable, and it has pleasant driving dynamics. But compared to other minivans, it has a narrower range of standard and available features. The Chrysler Voyager is a 7-seater vehicle that comes in 2 trim levels. The most popular style is the L FWD, which starts at $29,655 and comes with a 3.6L V6 engine and Front Wheel Drive. This Voyager is estimated to deliver 19 MPG in the city and 28 MPG on the highway.\n\nPros\n\nLeast expensive minivan on the market\nSmooth and quiet ride\nPotent engine\n\nCons\n\nFewer amenities than rival models\nNo standard driver-assist features\n\nOverall Assessment\n\nTypically, carmakers are happy to have just one minivan on their roster, but Chrysler is that odd bird with two: the Voyager and the Pacifica. The Voyager has a strong engine and agreeable handling, but its most appealing aspect is its low price. Costing less than the Honda Odyssey and Toyota Sienna, it's the least expensive minivan on the market.\n\nUnfortunately, the Voyager's accessible pricing requires some sacrifices. It offers fewer amenities than its competitors. For example, power-sliding side doors aren't available, and leather upholstery isn't on the options list. Still, if you want a budget-friendly minivan, you'll likely appreciate what the Voyager has to offer.\n",

The Honda Odyssey is a 8-seater vehicle that comes in 5 trim levels. The most popular style is the Sport, which starts at $42,505 and comes with a 3.5L V6 engine and Front Wheel Drive.

The Odyssey seats up to eight with plenty of head and legroom. Its third row is one of the largest in the class, offering considerably more legroom than you'll find in the Kia Carnival or Chrysler Pacifica. Plus, the Honda has more maximum cargo space than the Pacifica and Toyota Sienna. On the road, the Odyssey is smooth and refined. Ride quality is excellent, and light steering makes this sizable van very easy to park. Unlike some of its rivals, the Odyssey is not available as a hybrid or with all-wheel drive, but it is one of the quickest minivans on the market. Its powerful V6 engine offers a satisfying punch off the line and plenty of passing performance, even when the van is packed with passengers.",

It's a great choice for small businesses, taxi drivers, and families. The Wagon is built on the same heavy-duty frame as the Connect Cargo Van, giving it outsized strength for hauling people. The back seats fold flat, allowing the Transit to turn into an expert moving vehicle for large items. Today's minivans are more luxurious, but the Wagon offers similar safety tech and less bulk at a lower price. The Ford Transit Connect Wagon is a 6-seater vehicle that comes in 3 trim levels. The most popular style is the XLT with Rear Symmetrical Doors, which starts at $35,370 and comes with a 2.0L I4 engine and Front Wheel Drive. This Transit Connect Wagon is estimated to deliver 24 MPG in the city and 28 MPG on the highway.\n\nPros\n\nRefined chassis for comfortable long-distance travel. Smart cabin offers great configurability. Best-in-class infotainment system. Doubles as a cargo hauler.\n\nCons\n\nNot as sophisticated as a minivan. Missing a hybrid engine option. XL trim lacks popular features.\nOverall Assessment\nCompact and well-engineered, the Ford Transit Connect Wagon is a superb passenger vehicle. The smooth powertrain returns strong fuel economy numbers. Clever interior design provides space for people or oversized cargo. Ford's comfort and infotainment are best-in-class. Cabin materials and gadgets don't match modern minivans, but the value-priced Transit Connect Wagon remains one of the best vans on the market.",

      "description": "Overview\n\nThe Ford Transit Passenger Wagon's power, ride comfort, and ample interior room make it ideal for carrying up to 15 people. It's a well-stocked workhorse and one of the few available full-size passenger vans. The Ford Transit Passenger Wagon is a 10-seater vehicle that comes in 6 trim levels. The most popular style is the T-350 XL 148\" Medium Roof RWD, which starts at $49,470 and comes with a 3.5L V6 engine and Rear Wheel Drive.\n\nPros\n\nQuiet and comfortable interior splits the difference between a work van and a family SUV\nStrong towing and hauling ability\nSolid set of standard driver safety features\n\nCons\n\nPricier than competitors with similar features\nTight headroom\n\nOverall Assessment\n\nThree-row SUVs are great for getting your kids to soccer games or driving the neighbors out to dinner. But what about when you need to move the entire soccer team? Get the church group to the holiday service, or get the band to the next gig? For some jobs, only a full-size passenger van will do, and the 2022 Ford Transit Passenger Wagon is one of the few in this corner of the auto market.\n\nIt comes standard with 12-passenger seating but can seat up to 15 (you can also choose fewer seats and more cargo space). Two V6 engines deliver plenty of muscle, and there are multiple configurations of length and height. Inside, the Transit borrows from Ford's economy crossovers with useful interior design and simple, quality materials. A smooth ride, standard driver-safety features, and ample payload and towing limits round out the Transit Wagon's benefits.\n\nThe Mercedes-Benz Sprinter Passenger Van is the only other van with double-digit passenger capacity out there. The Ram ProMaster Crew Van is an option if you only need room for five, but it's really a cargo van with extra seats.\n\nSurprisingly, the base model Benz costs a bit less than the Ford, and both models match up well with feature offerings. The Sprinter has an optional turbodiesel V6 engine that may offer marginally better fuel efficiency (the Sprinter has not been EPA-rated), while the Transit's initial maintenance costs will be less than the Mercedes. Either will suit most buyers well, but for carrying large groups in comfort, the Ford Transit Passenger Wagon is an easy choice.\n",

Just don't consider it a substitute for a family minivan. The Mercedes-Benz Metris Passenger Van is a 8-seater vehicle that comes in 1 trim levels. The most popular style is the 126\" Wheelbase Standard Roof, which starts at $39,895 and comes with a 2.0L I4 Turbo engine and Rear Wheel Drive.

It shares the same sturdy chassis as the Metris Cargo Van, and an interior quality that, while not up to Benz sedan standards, still befits the brand as a commercial van. This last part is important: The Metris is, at heart, a work vehicle. It shouldn't be confused for a family minivan, even if it's tempting to soften the perceived stigma of minivan ownership with a three-pointed star on the grille.\n\nThe Metris isn't trying to be a minivan like the Honda Odyssey or Toyota Sienna. The Metris doesn't offer the same passenger space and legroom, or the same level of infotainment and driver-assist tech, or even similar fuel economy. Buyers who want a Mercedes family car are better off with one of its SUVs.\n\nThe Metris excels as a short-hop shuttle van, however, with seating for five to eight passengers, and generous cargo space even behind an upright third row. It is also fine as a small crew van, with tight handling and a midsize footprint that make it ideal for city work. In addition, it makes a solid foundation for camper van and RV conversions, with strong towing capacity enhancing its utility.\n\nThe Metris is shorter and smaller than its commercial peers — including the Ford Transit Passenger Wagon, Ram ProMaster Crew Van, and even Mercedes' own Sprinter — which limits its usefulness for big jobs. But for many business or recreational buyers, the Metris will prove to be just right.\n",

A low price, ample room, multiple configurations, and dozens of custom options offer a blank canvas for both mobile workers and van-lifers.\n\nPowered by a V6 engine and front-wheel drive, the ProMaster is one of the better choices for big-city maneuvering yet still offers robust hauling and towing ability. Updates for 2022 make the ProMaster more competitive, starting with a new multi-passenger Crew Van option, a new nine-speed transmission for increased fuel efficiency, and an interior and infotainment upgrade that delivers Apple CarPlay and Android Auto.\n\nAmong the Ram's competitors, the Ford Transit and Mercedes-Benz Sprinter offer all-wheel drive for wet climates, more refined interiors, and better ride comfort, but all three have similar towing and hauling limits. The Nissan NV Cargo costs less but can't handle as much payload. It does deliver impressive towing capacity when equipped with a meaty V8 engine, however.
