      "description": "Overview\n\nThe Toyota Tundra is all-new this year with improved infotainment and a new hybrid engine option. It includes a revised suspension system for a smoother ride and plenty of standard safety features, yet it still doesn't offer the wide array of configurations and engines of its competitors. The Toyota Tundra is a 5-seater vehicle that comes in 10 trim levels. The most popular style is the SR5 CrewMax 5.5' Bed 3.5L 4WD, which starts at $48,200 and comes with a 3.5L V6 Twin-Turbo engine and Four Wheel Drive. This Tundra is estimated to deliver 17 MPG in the city and 22 MPG on the highway.\n\nPros\n\nPowerful and efficient hybrid engine available\nMuch improved infotainment system\nLong list of standard safety features\n\nCons\n\nFewer configurations than competitors\nOnly two engines are available\nLess towing capacity than competitors\nOverall Assessment\nThe all-new 2022 Toyota Tundra is a full-size truck with improvements on all fronts. It now offers two engines, including a hybrid for better fuel efficiency. The suspension has been modified to improve the ride quality, and the all-new infotainment system with a massive available touchscreen is more responsive. There are six trims, rear-wheel or four-wheel drive, two cabs, and three-bed lengths. Its breadth of options make it versatile enough to work for family life or work life. But it still doesn't have quite the range of configurations as its competitors. The interior is also improved with better materials and more comfortable seating to match the Tundra's smoother ride. The Ram 1500 has a superior ride with more trims and more available engines. The Ford F-150 boasts the highest towing and payload rating in the segment. The Chevrolet Silverado 1500 offers more engines and more trims in its lineup but a less appealing interior.",

It doesn't ride as smoothly as some rivals, but the F-150 is still a top contender among pickups. The Ford F-150 is a 5-seater vehicle that comes in 8 trim levels. The most popular style is the XLT SuperCrew 5.5' Box 4WD, which starts at $49,770 and comes with a 3.3L V6 engine and Four Wheel Drive.

Its capability is unrivaled, boasting the highest towing and payload ratings of any full-size light-duty truck. A fuel-efficient hybrid is available, and the new electric F-150 Lightning (reviewed separately) hits showrooms this spring. The choices continue with rear-wheel or four-wheel drive, three bed lengths, and three cab configurations. The competition is fierce from popular alternatives such as the Ram 1500, which has a smoother ride and more attractive interior, and the Chevrolet Silverado 1500 with its multifunction tailgate. There's also the Toyota Tundra if you're looking for similar features at a lower price.",

With a high-output engine and all-wheel drive, it will enable the urban dweller to run errands during the week and enjoy on- and off-road adventures on the weekend. The Hyundai Santa Cruz is a 5-seater vehicle that comes in 4 trim levels. The most popular style is the SEL AWD, which starts at $30,435 and comes with a 2.5L I4 engine and All Wheel Drive. This Santa Cruz is estimated to deliver 21 MPG in the city and 27 MPG on the highway.\n\nPros\n\nEconomical and performance powertrains available\nLarge user interface screens\nUnique combination of utility and size\n\nCons\n\nLimited interior storage\nNo hybrid powertrain option\n\nOverall Assessment\n\nIn the 1970s, mini pickup trucks were all the rage. Japanese brands led the charge, and several domestic brands offered versions of their own as the phenomenon grew. Flash-forward 50 years and Hyundai is hoping to tap into the same zeitgeist with its all-new Santa Cruz \"sports adventure vehicle.\" But the concept has some new tricks, namely the five-passenger cabin that enables the Santa Cruz to transport a young family or two couples in comfort. Mini pickups never offered that. And few small pickups offered nearly the performance that the Santa Cruz offers with its optional 281-horsepower turbocharged engine. Inside, the creature comforts are exactly what one would expect from a recently designed compact crossover. And that's not surprising since the Santa Cruz is based on the brand-new Hyundai Tucson SUV. In some ways, the Santa Cruz channels the Tucson directly. But there are areas, such as the powertrain choices, for example, where the Santa Cruz goes its own way.\n\nBecause the Santa Cruz is creating its own segment, there are few vehicles to compare it to. One straight-up competitor is the 2022 Ford Maverick, which is very similar to the Santa Cruz but veers in a slightly more trucklike direction. The Santa Cruz is about 4 inches shorter than the Ford Maverick and rides on a slightly shorter wheelbase. The other obvious comparison is the Tucson because it and the Santa Cruz share a platform and many components. The Tucson is shorter than the Santa Cruz in overall length by about a foot with a significantly shorter wheelbase as well.\n",

The most popular style is the XL SuperCrew FWD, which starts at $22,490 and comes with a Hybrid 2.5L I4 engine and Front Wheel Drive. This Maverick is estimated to deliver 23 MPG in the city and 30 MPG on the highway.\n\nPros\n\nLow starting price\nCity-friendly dimensions\nStandard fuel-efficient hybrid engine\n\nCons\n\nNo hybrid all-wheel-drive combination\nModest hauling and towing capacity\n\nOverall Assessment\n\nThe all-new Ford Maverick is the smallest and least expensive pickup on the market. Unlike Ford's larger Ranger and F-Series pickups, which have rugged, real-deal truck chassis, the Maverick is mechanically similar to the Ford Escape crossover, so it's less of a work truck and more of a fun truck. With a standard hybrid engine or an available turbocharged gas engine, the Maverick is also the most fuel-efficient pickup available. And its size makes it ideal for urban environments.\n\nThat doesn't mean the Maverick, which is only offered in a four-door crew cab body style, is any less of a truck. It can still tow and carry a payload, and its highly customizable bed fits almost every lifestyle. And Ford offers a rugged FX4 package for extra off-road capability. Inside, there's a surprising amount of space, with seating for five and plenty of cubbies to hold your stuff. In addition to larger traditional pickups such as the Ranger and Nissan Frontier, the Maverick competes with the Hyundai Santa Cruz, which is a similar concept to the Maverick.\n",

The Nissan Frontier is a 5-seater vehicle that comes in 4 trim levels. The most popular style is the SV Crew Cab 2WD, which starts at $34,085 and comes with a 3.8L V6 engine and Rear Wheel Drive. This Frontier is estimated to deliver 18 MPG in the city and 24 MPG on the highway.\n\nPros\n\nStandard 310-horsepower V6 engine\nUp-to-date infotainment features\nComfortable front seats\n\nCons\n\nMost driver-assist tech costs extra\nNo rear-seat climate-control air vents\nNo telescopic steering wheel\n\nOverall Assessment\n\nNo automaker has had a longer run in the U.S. compact and midsize pickup market than Nissan. That presence waned in recent years, however, as Nissan's entry, the midsize Frontier, grew stale while newer, fresher competitors entered the segment.\n\nA redesign of the Nissan Frontier for 2022 restores its market mojo with all-new sheet metal featuring a square-jawed front end, massive grille, muscular flanks, and wide stance. The ruggedly handsome exterior opens to a modern, attractive cabin fitted with the latest in infotainment technology and driver-assist features. Under the skin, the new Frontier gets quicker ratio steering, suspension refinements aimed at improving handling, and new hydraulic body mounts that reduce cab \"jiggle.\"\n\nThere are still two cab layouts: King Cab and Crew Cab. The King Cab is Nissan's name for a four-passenger extended cab with short, rear-hinged doors and two occasional-use rear jump seats. The five-passenger Crew Cab has four regular-size, front-hinged doors, and a three-person rear bench seat. The King Cab is only available with base S and midlevel SV models.\n\nAs with most other midsize pickups, the Frontier offers two bed sizes. A bed measuring 5-feet long comes standard with the Crew Cab, while a 6-footer is included with the King Cab and long-wheelbase SV Crew Cab.\n\nThe segment-leading Toyota Tacoma is due for a complete redesign in a year or so, but in the meantime the Frontier offers more horsepower, a roomier back seat in both cab styles, better handling, more comfortable and ergonomically pleasing front seats, and a more up-to-date infotainment system than the current model-year Tacoma. This Frontier, however, doesn't offer the carlike ride and handling of the Honda Ridgeline or the bigger towing ratings of the Ford Ranger and Jeep Gladiator, or the Chevrolet Colorado and GMC Canyon diesels.\n",

Some might consider its single engine offering a drawback, but we like the performance of the standard 270-horsepower, 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine. It works well with the 10-speed automatic transmission to deliver a responsive feel and solid fuel mileage numbers. We're less impressed by the Ranger's ride quality as it's on the firm side, which makes for a busy ride on rough roads.\n\nOffered in three levels of trim, two body styles (extended or crew cab) and rear- or four-wheel drive, the Ranger offers a wide range of setups. A number of options packages with different themes make the Ranger stand out among its many rivals.

Instead of the traditional body-on-frame construction with a solid-axle rear end, the Ridgeline adopted unibody construction with an independent rear suspension. While most midsize pickups offer cab-style, bed-length, and engine choices galore, the Ridgeline comes with a five-passenger crew cab body, all-wheel drive, and a single available engine. While it looks like a conventional midsize pickup, it drives differently. Competitive midsize trucks, such as the Toyota Tacoma, Nissan Frontier, Chevrolet Colorado, GMC Canyon, and Ford Ranger are very similar to each other in construction, capabilities, and looks. The Jeep Gladiator is another midsize truck that stands apart.\n\nThe Ridgeline is about 2 inches shorter than the shortest Tacoma and Colorado, and it's half an inch shorter than the crew-cab Ranger.

It offered everything truck buyers were looking for and had few competitors. There are now more choices in this segment, but the Tacoma remains a top contender. Much of its appeal comes from a reputation for durability, off-road capability, and a lineup that offers everything from a two-wheel-drive extended cab up to a four-wheel-drive TRD Pro. Base models come standard with a four-cylinder engine with 159 horsepower while higher trims get a larger V6 with 278 hp. Both cab styles feature four doors, but the extended cab uses smaller reverse opening rear doors while the crew cab gets standard, full-size rear doors. Both 5- and 6-foot bed lengths are available along with rear- or four-wheel drive. Upgrade packages from Toyota Racing Development (TRD) gives the Tacoma improved performance on the road or in the dirt depending on the package. The Tacoma's interior favors function over form as most of the controls use large knobs and buttons. Recent improvements to the user interface have made the touchscreen controls easier to operate, but it's still not the best system in the class.\n\nKey competitors include the Ford Ranger and newly redesigned Nissan Frontier, along with long-time rivals, the Chevrolet Colorado and GMC Canyon twins. There's also the Jeep Gladiator which matches the Tacoma for off-road capability but lacks the diverse array of configurations.\n",

While it offers the styling of the iconic Jeep Wrangler, it also borrows some components and engineering philosophy from the well-regarded Ram 1500 full-size pickup. This results in a vehicle that can go anywhere a Wrangler can go while carrying a serious amount of cargo in its ample pickup truck bed. While some other midsize trucks, such as the Toyota Tacoma, have proud off-road histories and serious modern-day capabilities of their own, the Gladiator was designed and engineered to be the best off-roader among pickup trucks, bar none.

Toyota also offers a long-bed crew cab that is 7 inches longer than the Gladiator. But comparing the Gladiator directly to conventional pickups like the Tacoma and Frontier is flawed because they can't match the Gladiator's fun-to-drive, open-air nature.

The midsize pickup comes in two-bed lengths (5-foot-2-inch and 6-foot-2-inch) and two cabs (Extended and Crew). And every model is available in two-wheel drive or four-wheel drive.

A four-cylinder is the base engine on some models, and a more expensive diesel is also available. The V6 offers more power and quicker acceleration than most midsize trucks. Although the Colorado is the elder statesman of the midsize pickup class, it's still a strong contender with a comfortable ride, easy maneuverability and, on some models, off-road capability that outshines most 4X4 trucks.\n\nThe competitors' models are a year or more newer than the Chevy. And Colorado's sales numbers have fallen slightly every year for the past four years. The Gladiator and Ford Ranger outsell the Chevy by a slight margin, while the class-leading Toyota Tacoma outsells it by a wide gap. The all-new 2022 Nissan Frontier looks to be a strong competitor, too. However, for most buyers, the Colorado is an excellent midsize truck.\n",

      "name": "2022 Ram 3500",
      "description": "Overview\n\nThe Ram 3500 is a masterclass in hauling strength, the hulking flagship of Ram's lineup of trucks offering a maximum towing capacity of 37,100 lbs. Dual rear wheels are available for earth-shifting traction. Shoppers can opt for a Mega Cab four-door model with its vast interior space, and all Rams provide a surprisingly smooth ride and high-quality cabin materials, making this hard-working truck quite luxurious. The Ram 3500 is a 6-seater vehicle that comes in 6 trim levels. The most popular style is the Tradesman Crew Cab 8' Box 4WD, which starts at $52,985 and comes with a 6.4L V8 engine and Four Wheel Drive.\n\nPros\n\nBest-in-class towing abilities.

      "name": "2022 GMC Sierra 1500",
      "description": "Overview\n\nThe GMC Sierra 1500 is a full-size truck with good capability, roomy front seats, and a well-appointed interior. It has high tow ratings and can carry plenty of cargo, but its ride quality doesn't match the comfort of the competition. The GMC Sierra 1500 is a 6-seater vehicle that comes in 8 trim levels. The most popular style is the Elevation with 3SB Crew Cab Short Bed 4WD, which starts at $55,995 and comes with a 2.7L I4 Turbo engine and Four Wheel Drive. This Sierra 1500 is estimated to deliver 17 MPG in the city and 20 MPG on the highway.\n\nPros\n\nPowerful engines\nSpacious interior\nLuxurious top trims\n\nCons\n\nPricing climbs quickly with options\nRide is stiffer than the competition\n\nOverall Assessment\n\nThe GMC Sierra 1500 has a wide range of luxurious trims, especially with the Denali and new Denali Ultimate. GMC improved the interior of the Sierra 1500 this year and it shows in both the look and feel of material choices. Top trims get open-pore wood and rich leathers, but quality materials abound in all models. There are four engine options, including a diesel, which help make the Sierra 1500 a capable work truck. Infotainment includes a new larger touchscreen with a wide range of features. Also, there are numerous standard safety features and the new Super Cruise driver-assist technology on Sierra Denali pickups.\n\nIn comparison, the Ford F-150 offers more trim levels, a hybrid, and better off-road capability in its Raptor trim. The Ram 1500 has an equally upscale interior and a more comfortable ride.\n",

      "name": "2022 GMC HUMMER EV",
      "description": "Overview\n\nThe new GMC Hummer EV pickup boasts impressive power and off-road capability, but its high starting price and limited towing and payload ratings narrow its appeal. The GMC HUMMER EV is a 5-seater vehicle that comes in 1 trim levels. The most popular style is the Edition 1 Crew Cab, which starts at $110,295 and comes with an Electric engine and Four Wheel Drive.\n\nPros\n\nImpressive power\nUnique off-road capabilities\nUp to 350 miles of driving range\n\nCons\n\nCumbersome size\nLower tow rating than rival EV pickups\nHigh price point\n\nOverall Assessment\n\nThe GMC Hummer EV is an all-new, all-electric pickup truck. The Hummer lineup will eventually include a range of trucks and SUVs with one big difference from the Hummers of old. Instead of gas-guzzling monsters, the new range will be entirely electric. The first to reach production is the Hummer EV pickup. The Edition 1 trim, the first available, is sold out. Buyers can join the waiting list for future versions.\n\nThe Hummer EV provides excellent off-road capability and a long driving range to maximize time between charges. Its spacious interior can comfortably carry five adults, and the latest driver-assist safety technologies are included. But a six-figure starting price puts it out of reach for many buyers, and low tow and payload ratings might discourage those who need a truck to do serious work.\n\nThe Hummer has no direct competitor in terms of size and capability, but those looking for a pickup EV can consider the Ford F-150 Lightning. Its top trim level is priced beneath the Hummer's starting point. The innovative Rivian R1T costs less as well, and provides a much higher tow rating (11,000 pounds compared to the Hummer EV's 7,500-pound rating).\n",

      "name": "2022 GMC Sierra 2500HD",
      "description": "Overview\n\nThe GMC Sierra 2500HD is a heavy-duty full-size pickup that's built to haul big loads with comfort and ease. When outfitted in the most luxurious Denali trim, the 2500 is one of the most refined, upscale, and composed trucks in the class. The GMC Sierra 2500HD is a 5-seater vehicle that comes in 5 trim levels. The most popular style is the Denali Crew Cab Standard Bed 4WD, which starts at $71,395 and comes with a 6.6L V8 engine and Four Wheel Drive.\n\nPros\n\nEasy to maneuver\nOptional all-wheel-drive mode\nSmart trailering technology\n\nCons\n\nLimited off-road capability\nNo 10-speed transmission for the gas V8 engine\nSmall infotainment screen\n\nOverall Assessment\n\nThe Sierra 2500HD was last redesigned for 2020. So this one is the newest of the heavy-duty pickup trucks. GMC, as well as its Chevrolet sister brand, forged a unique path years ago by offering the only heavy-duty pickup with four-wheel drive and an independent front suspension instead of an old-tech solid front axle. The GM trucks have long been known as some of the easiest to drive and best handling of the workhorse pickups. Plus, GMC offers the upscale Denali model that adds serious luxury to the mix.\n\nBut just because a truck is easy to drive doesn't mean it gives up towing or hauling capability. GMC offers two powerplants: the standard 401-horsepower gas-powered 6.6-liter V8 and the 6.6-liter V8 Duramax diesel, which delivers a solid 910 pound-feet of torque. The top Sierra HD can move 3,979 pounds in its bed. And the maximum tow rating for the pickup is 18,500 pounds. GMC offers a great rear camera system that, on some models, provides two trailer views as well as a hitch guidance system. In addition, the GM trucks are the only heavy-duty pickups to offer an all-wheel-drive mode within the 4WD system. That gives the driver confidence when hauling or towing a trailer in foul weather. However, when it comes to off-roading, the Sierra isn't as capable as its rivals. The AT4 off-road package is best suited to dirt roads and mild trails.\n",

      "description": "Overview\n\nThe GMC Sierra 3500HD is one of the most capable trucks available when it comes to towing. Smart tech features make trailering even easier, but the interior design and quality fall short of the competition. The GMC Sierra 3500HD is a 5-seater vehicle that comes in 5 trim levels. The most popular style is the Denali Crew Cab Long Bed 4WD, which starts at $72,795 and comes with a 6.6L V8 engine and Four Wheel Drive.\n\nPros\n\nSerious power for serious towing\nCabin is big on space and storage\nSmart apps and cameras make towing a breeze\n\nCons\n\nInterior looks and feels dated\nDenali trim isn't as luxurious as other range-topping trucks\nForward visibility is hampered by a huge hood\nOverall Assessment\nWhen it comes to serious heavy-duty trucks, there are only three choices, and the GMC Sierra 3500HD is one of the most capable. Properly configured with a stout turbodiesel engine and dual rear wheels, this massive pickup can tow up to 36,000 pounds. In this select class of trucks, only the Ram 3500 beats the GMC, and only by 1,090 lbs. Meanwhile, the Ford Super Duty F-350 is limited to 32,000 lbs. The Sierra is further bolstered by a spacious cabin, versatile MultiPro tailgate, and several tech features that make towing even easier. Curiously, however, adaptive cruise control is not offered. The 3500HD's interior would benefit from a similar refresh as its GMC Sierra 1500 sibling, but it's stuck with a carryover that falls short of rivals' design and quality.",

      "name": "2022 Nissan Titan XD",
      "description": "Overview\n\nThe roomy and powerful Nissan Titan XD is the perfect full-size pickup for buyers who need more than a light-duty pickup, but less than a true heavy-duty truck. The Nissan Titan XD is a 5-seater vehicle that comes in 4 trim levels. The most popular style is the PRO-4X, which starts at $57,765 and comes with a 5.6L V8 engine and Four Wheel Drive.\n\nPros\n\nBig, powerful V8 engine\nSurprisingly comfortable ride\nImpressive standard safety features\n\nCons\n\nCompetitors offer more body styles\nNo diesel engine option\nPlain cabin design\nOverall Assessment\nMore capable than the standard Nissan Titan, the Nissan Titan XD is the brand's largest, most powerful, and most capable pickup. The XD isn't the heavy-duty option some buyers need for commercial-grade towing and hauling, but it comes with a 5.6-liter 400-horsepower V8 engine, four-wheel drive, an extremely spacious cabin, and a surprisingly smooth ride. That's more standard horsepower than you'll find in the Chevrolet Silverado, Ford F-150, Ram 1500, and the Toyota Tundra. The Titan XD can tow up to an impressive 11,060 pounds and haul up to 2,430 pounds of payload. Every Titan XD also features a popular Crew Cab body style and a 6.5-foot bed, so it's perfect for weekly jobsite duty and weekend adventures with boats, horses, and toys in tow. Unlike its heavy-duty rivals from Chevy, GMC, Ram, and the best-selling Ford F-Series Super-Duty, the Titan XD is not available with a diesel engine, a longer bed, or a dual rear axle. Off-road enthusiasts should check out the Pro-4X model; it's quite good off the pavement.",
